# ds-cli
DS-CLI is now a core runtime component of DesktopServer. This repo automates the installation of the runtimes for the latest command line interface tools such as WP-CLI, Composer, PHPUnit, and other cross-platform components that are important to professional WordPress developers.

To build the latest runtime:

## Buliding on Mac
1) Start a command line prompt (Terminal.app)
2) Change directory to project (i.e. /Users/jsmith/Documents/ds-cli)
3) Execute ./buildsh (be sure to answer any sudo prompts for password)

## Building on Windows
1) Start a command line prompt (cmd.exe)
2) Change directory to project (i.e. c:\Users\jsmith\Documents\ds-cli)
3) Execute build.bat (be sure to answer any UAC prompts)
