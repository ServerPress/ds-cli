This directory /etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/ contains 
CA certificate bundle files which are automatically created
based on the information found in the
/usr/share/pki/ca-trust-source/ and /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/
directories.

All files are in the BEGIN/END CERTIFICATE file format, 
as decribed in the x509(1) manual page.

Distrust information cannot be represented in this file format,
and distrusted certificates are missing from these files.

If your application isn't able to load the PKCS#11 module p11-kit-trust.so,
then you can use these files in your application to load a list of global
root CA certificates.

Please never manually edit the files stored in this directory,
because your changes will be lost and the files automatically overwritten,
each time the update-ca-trust command gets executed.

Please refer to the update-ca-trust(8) manual page for additional information.
