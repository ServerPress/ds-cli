This is the GNU `groff' document formatting system.  The version
number is given in the file VERSION.

Included in this release are implementations of `troff', `pic', `eqn',
`tbl', `grn', `refer', `-man', `-mdoc', `-mom', and `-ms' macros, and
drivers for `PostScript', `PDF', `TeX DVI' format, `HP LaserJet 4'
printers, `Canon CAPSL' printers, `HTML' and `XHTML' formats (beta
status), and typewriter-like devices.  Also included is a modified
version of the Berkeley `-me' macros, the enhanced version `gxditview'
of the X11 `xditview' previewer, and an implementation of the `-mm'
macros contributed by Joergen Haegg.

See the file `INSTALL' for instructions on how to install from a
release.  You will require a C++ compiler.

The file `INSTALL.REPO' contains supplementary instructions for
building directly from a clone of the repository or a snapshot
tarball.

The file `NEWS' describes recent user-visible changes to `groff'.

`groff' is free software.  See the file `COPYING' for copying
permission.

The file `PROBLEMS' describes various problems that have been
encountered in compiling, installing, and running `groff'.

The file `MORE.STUFF' contains information about add-on packages
useful for `groff'.

The most recent released version of `groff' is always available by
anonymous ftp from `ftp.gnu.org' in the directory `gnu/groff'.

The current development version of `groff' is available from a git
repository at

  https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=groff

To view the git repository in your browser, go to

  http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/groff.git

There you can also download snapshots; simply click on a commit entry
line to get the URL.

Depending on your requirements, you may need at least some of the
following tools to build `groff' directly from its source:

  perl >= v5.6.1 (see macro GROFF_PERL in file `m4/groff.m4')
  ghostscript
  the psutils package
  the netpbm package
  texinfo 4.8
  bison >= 1.875b or byacc

Note that `texinfo' and `bison' or `byacc' are required only for
building from repository sources (either a checked out working copy,
or a commit snapshot).  They are not required for building from a
stable release tarball.  Also note that the version numbers stated are
the minimum supported.  No version of `texinfo' < 4.8 works, and the
original release of `bison' 1.875 is known not to work; you *may* find
that `bison' releases < 1.875 work, but in case of difficulty, please
update to a later version *before* posting a bug report.

For *all* sources, you need `ghostscript' for creation of either `PDF'
or `HTML' output; the `netpbm' and `psutils' packages are required
only for `HTML' output (and for compilation from the repository).  If
you don't intend to produce output in either of these formats, then
these packages are unnecessary.

Additionally, producing `PDF' output directly with the `gropdf' device needs
a working installation of `perl'.  The same is true for some other
preprocessors like `chem'.

In Linux Debian, the installation of `texinfo' is dangerous.  For it
creates a file `install-info' that blocks the system installation.  So
the created `/usr/local/bin/install-info' must be renamed.

The `groff' configure script searches for the X11 headers and
libraries `Xaw' and `Xmu'.  So the corresponding developer packages of
your system must be installed, otherwise `groff' does not install
`gxditview' and the `-TX*' devices.  In Debian, the developer packages
are `libxaw7-dev' and `libxmu-dev'.

Please report bugs using the bug tracker available from the project
page at

  https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/groff

Alternatively, but less preferable, you may use the form in the file
`BUG-REPORT'; the idea of this is to make sure that FSF has all the
information it needs to fix the bug.  At the very least, read the
`BUG-REPORT' form and make sure that you supply all the information
that it asks for.  Even if you are not sure that something is a bug,
report it using `BUG-REPORT': this enables us to determine whether it
really is a bug or not.

Three mailing lists are available:

  bug-groff@gnu.org          for reporting bugs and following bug
                             reports
  groff@gnu.org              for general discussion of groff
  groff-commit@gnu.org       a read-only list to follow commits
                             to the git repository

To subscribe, send a mail to <list>-request@<domain> (example:
groff-request@gnu.org for the `groff' list) with the word `subscribe'
in either the subject or body of the e-mail (don't include the quotes).
Alternatively, you may subscribe by visiting the web pages at

  http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-groff
  http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/groff
  http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/groff-commit

Each of these web pages also provides a link to a browseable archive of
postings to the corresponding mailing list.
