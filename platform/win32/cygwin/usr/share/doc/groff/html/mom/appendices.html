<h2 id="fonts" class="docs">Adding fonts to groff</h2>

<div id="small-note" class="box-tip">
<p class="tip-top">
<kbd>&lt;prefix&gt;</kbd>, in this section, refers
to the directory in which groff is installed, typically
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  /usr/share/groff/
</span>
(for distro-specific, pre-compiled groff packages) or
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">

<p>
Groff comes with a small library of 
<a href="definitions.html#family">families</a>
(see the
<a href="typesetting.html#family">FAMILY</a>
macro for a list).  The families have four
<a href="definitions.html#font">fonts</a>
associated with them.  These fonts are a combination of
<a href="definitions.html#weight">weight</a>
and
<a href="definitions.html#shape">shape</a>:
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  R  (Roman, usually Medium weight),
  I  (Italic, usually Medium weight),
  B  (Bold, usually Roman shape) and
  BI (Bold Italic)
</span>
If you work with mom a lot, sooner or later you&#8217;ll find that these
families and their associated fonts aren&#8217;t sufficient.  You&#8217;ll
want to supplement them, either with more fonts for the families
already provided&mdash;<i>Damn!  I need Helvetica Bold Condensed
Italic</i>&mdash;or with entire new families.
</p>

<h3 id="extending" class="docs">Extending groff families / adding new families and fonts</h3>

<h4 id="traditional" class="docs">The traditional approach</h4>

<p>
The traditional approach to extending groff families has been
to create new families for non-default weights and shapes (e.g.
<b>Light</b>, which is a
<a href="definitions.html#weight">weight</a>,
or <b>Condensed</b>, which is a
<a href="definitions.html#shape">shape</a>),
then to associate them with groff&#8217;s predefined <b>R,
I, B</b> and <b>BI</b> font styles.  An example of this
can be seen in the groff PostScript font library itself, which is
found in
</br>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/font/devps/
</span>
There&#8217;s one &#8220;family&#8221; for Helvetica (<b>HR</b>,
<b>HI</b>, <b>HB</b>, <b>HBI</b>) and another for Helvetica Narrow
(<b>HNR</b>, <b>HNI</b>, <b>HNB</b>, <b>HNBI</b>).
</p>

<p>
The difficulty with this approach is that typographers tend to
think of families as referring to the entire set of font weights
and shapes associated with a family name.  For example, when
a typesetter says &#8220;the Helvetica family&#8221;, s/he is
including the weights Helvetica Thin, Helvetica Light, Helvetica
Regular, Helvetica Bold, Helvetica Heavy, etc, and all their
associated shapes (Roman, Italic, Condensed, Narrow, Extended,
Outline, etc).
</p>

<p>
Thus, intuitively, when a typesetter gives mom a
<kbd>.FAMILY&nbsp;H</kbd> directive, s/he reasonably expects that
any subsequent <kbd>.FT</kbd> directive will access the desired font
from the Helvetica family&mdash;without the need to state explicitly
both family and font to <kbd>.FT</kbd>, as it is explained one can
do in the
<a href="typesetting.html#family">FAMILY</a>
and
<a href="typesetting.html#font">FT</a>
sections of these documents.
</p>

<p>
If one had, say, Helvetica Light Roman and Helvetica Light Italic
as well as Helvetica Light Condensed Roman and Helvetica Light
Condensed Italic, the established groff approach would require two
&#8220;partial&#8221; families, <b>HL</b> (for Helvetica Light)
and <b>HLCD</b> (for Helvetica Light Condensed), with <b>R</b> and
<b>I</b> fonts for both:
</br>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  HLR
  HLI
  HLCDR
  HLCDI
</span>
Accessing these family/font combos routinely
throughout a document would then require changing the family
(with <kbd>.FAMILY</kbd>) and selecting the desired font
(with <kbd>.FT&nbsp;R</kbd> or <kbd>.FT&nbsp;I</kbd>), or
passing <kbd>.FT</kbd> the lengthy family+fontname (.e.g.
<kbd>.FT&nbsp;HLCDI</kbd>).
</p>

<h4 id="simpler" class="docs">The simpler way with mom</h4>

<p>
Fortunately, groff provides a mechanism whereby it&#8217;s possible
to extend the basic <b>R</b>, <b>I</b>, <b>B</b> and <b>BI</b> fonts
(&#8220;styles&#8221; in groff-speak) so that one can, in fact,
create extensive type families, and access all the fonts in them
with <kbd>.ft</kbd> (groff) or <kbd>.FT</kbd> (mom).
</p>

<p>
Mom uses this mechanism to offer, in addition to groff&#8217;s
default font styles, the following:

<p style="clear: both;">
Thus, with mom, if you&#8217;ve installed some extra
Helvetica fonts and named them according to the convention
<kbd>&lt;F&gt;&lt;S&gt;</kbd> (where <kbd>&lt;F&gt;</kbd> means
family and <kbd>&lt;S&gt;</kbd> means font style), once having
entered
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp" style="margin-bottom: -1em;">
  .FAMILY H
</span>
you can access any of the extra Helvetica fonts simply by passing
the correct argument to
<a href="typesetting.html#font">FT</a>
from the list, above.  For example, if you were working in Medium
Roman (<kbd>.FT&nbsp;R</kbd>) and you needed Medium Condensed Italic
for a while (assuming it&#8217;s installed), you&#8217;d just type
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp" style="margin-bottom: -1em;">
  .FT CDI
</span>
to access the Medium Condensed Italic font from the Helvetica
family.
</p>

<p>
Mom&#8217;s list of font styles doesn&#8217;t pretend to be
exhaustive.  The extension names are arbitrary and can be used in a
flexible manner.  For example, if you create a family that has a
Demibold font (<b>DB</b>) but no Bold font (<b>B</b>), you might
find it more convenient to give the Demibold font the extension
&#8220;<b>B</b>&#8221;.
</p>

<p id="register-style">
You may, at needs, want to add to mom&#8217;s list of font styles.
You can do this by editing the file, om.tmac (typical location:
<kbd>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/tmac/om.tmac</kbd>).  Near the
top, you&#8217;ll see lines of the form
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  .sty \n[.fp] XL      \" Extra Light
  .sty \n[.fp] L       \" Light Roman
  .sty \n[.fp] LI      \" Light Italic
  .sty \n[.fp] LCD     \" Light Condensed Roman
</span>
Simply add your new font style by imitating what you see, above,
and plugging in your new font style (having, of course, 
added the font to groff, correctly named).
directory; see
<a href="#steps">Step-by-step instructions</a>).
</p>

<p>
For example, if you already have some fonts from the Univers family
installed and have called the family <b>Univers</b>, you might decide at
some point to add the Bold Outline font (<b>UniversBO</b>).  In which
case, you&#8217;d add
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  .sty \n[.fp] BO      \" Bold Outline
</span>
to the <kbd>.sty&nbsp;\n[.fp]&nbsp; &lt;font style&gt;</kbd> list
in om.tmac.

<div class="box-tip">

<span class="note">Note:</span>
Mom&#8217;s font extensions are not &#8220;user-space&#8221;
controllable via a macro.  If you&#8217;ve been using groff for
a long time, and have already rolled your own solution to adding
families and fonts to groff, you may find that mom&#8217;s font
extensions conflict with your own scheme.  Should that be the case,
comment out the <kbd>.sty&nbsp;\n[.fp] &lt;font style&gt;</kbd>

style &#8220;<b>C</b>&#8221;, thinking that <kbd>.FT&nbsp;C</kbd>
would give you access to font style once you&#8217;d given a

<p>
There are a number of ways to approach making fonts available
to groff.  These instructions aren&#8217;t meant to cover all
possibilities, merely one.
</p>

<p>
GNU/Linux distributions being what they are, directory locations
may differ and the presence of some executables can&#8217;t be
guaranteed.  I run a Debian-based system.  The instructions reflect
that.  Users of other distros may have to interpret them according
to the way their distro operates.
</p>

<h3 id="need" class="docs appendices">What you need before you start</h3>

<ul style="margin-top: 1em; margin-left: -.5em;">
  <li>groff, version 1.18 or higher<br/>
      (Debian package: groff)
  </li>
  <li>ghostscript<br/>
      (Debian package: ghostscript or ghostscript-x)
  </li>
  <li>fontforge<br/>
      (Debian package: fontforge)
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="preparation" class="docs appendices">Initial preparation (you only need do this once)</h3>

<ol id="site-font" style="margin-left: -1em;">
  <li>
    Locate the groff directory,
    <kbd>site-font</kbd>.  The exact location is
    difficult to predict, owing to differences between distros and
    whether you&#8217;re using a pre-packaged groff or have built
    it from source.  Some typical locations are:
    <br/>
    <span class="pre-in-pp" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
      /usr/share/groff/
      /usr/local/share/groff/
      /etc/groff/
    </span>
    If you can&#8217;t find the site-font directory, locate
    groff&#8217;s <kbd>site-tmac</kbd> directory, and, as root,
    create site-font in the same directory.  Eg, if you find
    site-tmac in <kbd>/usr/share/groff/</kbd>, create site-font in
    <kbd>/usr/share/groff/</kbd>
    <br/>
    <span class="pre-in-pp" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
      sudo mkdir site-font
    </span>
  </li>
  <li>
    Create two files, generate-t42.pe and generate-pfa.pe,
    as you see them below.  Place them in a convenient and
    easily-remembered location, like your home directory.
    <br/>
    <span class="examples" style="font-size: 95%; display: block; margin-top: .5em;">generate-t42.pe</span>

    <div class="examples-container" style="margin-top: 0; margin-bottom: -1em; padding-bottom: 1em;">
<span class="pre">
# generate-t42.pe

Open($1);
Generate($fontname + ".pfa");
Generate($fontname + ".t42");
</span>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <span class="examples" style="font-size: 95%; display: block; margin-top: .5em;">generate-pfa.pe</span>
    <div class="examples-container" style="margin-top: 0; padding-bottom: 1em;">
<span class="pre">
# generate-pfa.pe

Open($1);
Generate($fontname + ".pfa");
</span>
    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="step-1" class="docs appendices">Step 1: Acquire the font</h3>

<p class="top">
The two most commonly available types of fonts are PostScript Type1
(extension .pfb) and TrueType (extension .ttf).  Either can be made
available to groff.  There are many websites holding collections of
both.
</p>

<h3 id="step-2" class="docs appendices">Step 2: Prepare to convert the font to the correct format</h3>

<p class="top">
Change into the directory holding the new font.
</p>

<p>
For convenience in the next step, make a symbolic link to 
the file 'textmap':
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  ln -s &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/font/devps/generate/textmap .
</span>
See
<a href="#small-note">here</a>
for an explanation of &lt;prefix&gt;
and &lt;version&gt;.
</p>

<p>
In addition, unless you're installing fonts from your home
directory, make links to the files 'generate-t42.pe' and
'generate-pfa.pe'.
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  ln -s $HOME/generate-t42.pe .
  ln -s $HOME/generate-pfa.pe .
</p>

<h3 id="step-3" class="docs appendices">Step 3: Convert the font and put it in the right place</h3>

<p class="top">
TrueType fonts (.ttf) need to be converted to .t42.  Type 1 fonts
(.pfb) need to be converted to .pfa.
</p>

<h4 id="ttf" class="docs" style="font-size: 90%; text-transform: uppercase;">&nbsp;&bullet;&nbsp;TTF Fonts</h4>

<p class="top" style="margin-top: .5em;">
For .ttf fonts, run
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  fontforge -script generate-t42.pe &lt;file&gt;.ttf
</span>
This will create three new files with the extensions .t42, .pfa, and
.afm.  Next, run
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  afmtodit &lt;afm file&gt; textmap &lt;groff font&gt;
</span>
This will create a groff font with the name you give.  (See
<a href="#groff-font-names">here</a>
for advice on naming groff fonts.)
</p>

<p>
Move the .t42 and groff font files to
<kbd>&lt;prefix&gt;/site-font/devps/</kbd>.
</p>

<p>
If you're running a recent version of groff that includes
the native pdf device (gropdf), move the .pfa file to
<kbd>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/font/devpdf/</kbd>.  If not, you
may safely remove it.  You may also safely remove the .afm file.
</p>

<h4 id="type1" class="docs" style="font-size: 90%; text-transform: uppercase;">&nbsp;&bullet;&nbsp;Type1 Fonts</h4>

<p class="top" style="margin-top: .5em;">
For .pfb fonts, run
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  fontforge -script generate-pfa.pe &lt;file&gt;.ttf
</span>
This will create two new files with the extensions .pfa, and .afm.
Next, run
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  afmtodit &lt;afm file&gt; textmap &lt;groff font&gt;
</span>
Move the .pfa and groff font files to
<kbd>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;site-font&gt;/devps/</kbd>.
(See
<a href="#groff-font-names">here</a>
for advice on naming groff fonts.)
</p>

<p>
If you're running a recent version of groff that includes the
native pdf device (gropdf), link the .pfa and groff font files,
now in <kbd>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;site-font&gt;/devps/</kbd>,
to the devpdf directory</kbd>.  Start by changing into the
<kbd>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/font/devpdf/</kbd> directory,
then:
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  ln -s &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/font/devps/&lt;file&gt;.pfa .
  ln -s &lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/font/devps/&lt;groff font&gt; .

You may safely remove the .afm file.

<h3 id="step-4" class="docs appendices">Step 4: Update the download file</h3>

<h4 id="internal" class="docs" style="font-size: 90%; text-transform: uppercase;">&nbsp;&bullet;&nbsp;Get the internal font name</h4>

<p class="top" style="margin-top: .5em;">
Inspect your new groff font file.  Near the top, you will see a line
of the form
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  internalname &lt;name&gt;
</span>
Usually, the internal name is helpfully descriptive, eg,
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  internalname Optima-Bold
</span>
Make a note of the internal name.
</p>

<h4 id="add" class="docs" style="font-size: 90%; text-transform: uppercase;">&nbsp;&bullet;&nbsp;Add the font to the download file</h4>

<p class="top" style="margin-top: .5em;">
Open the file <kbd>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/font/devps/download</kbd>.
In it you will see lines of the form
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  Symbol-Slanted       symbolsl.pfa
  ZapfDingbats-Reverse zapfdr.pfa
  FreeEuro             freeeuro.pfa
</span>
where the spaces are the tab character from the keyboard, not
literal spaces.  Thus,
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  Symbol-Slanted       symbolsl.pfa
</span>
is really
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  Symbol-Slanted&lt;tab&gt;symbolsl.pfa
</span>
</p>

<p>
The download file maps the internal names used by groff to the
actual fonts.  To add your new font to the download file, append a
line containing the internal name, followed by a tab (make sure your
text editor is inserting the tab character, not spaces), followed by
the .t42 or .pfa font to which the internal name refers.
</p>

<p>
For example, if the internal name is Optima-Bold and the font is a
.pfa file called Optima-Bold.pfa, your updated download file will

<h4 id="gropdf-download" class="docs" style="font-size: 90%; text-transform: uppercase;">&nbsp;&bullet;&nbsp;Updating the gropdf download file</h4>

<p class="top" style="margin-top: .5em;">
If you're running a recent version of groff that includes the
native pdf device (gropdf), you must update its download file as
well, which is found in <kbd>&lt;prefix&gt;/&lt;version&gt;/font/devpdf/</kbd>.
The instructions are identical to those above, but with one important
difference: all lines must begin with a tab character.  Thus, using
our Optima example, your devpdf download line for the same font is
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  &lt;tab&gt;Optima-Bold&lt;tab&gt;Optima-Bold.pfa
</span>
</p>

<h3 id="groff-font-names" class="docs appendices">Naming groff fonts</h3>
 
<p class="top">
For convenience when using mom, and to keep your font collection
organized, choose meaningful groff font names following the scheme
&lt;Family&gt;&lt;FONT&gt;, where Family is something
like Optima or Univers or Clarendon, and FONT is either
<br/>
<span style="display: block; margin-left: 2em;">
<kbd>R&nbsp;&nbsp;</kbd>(roman/regular)
<br/>
<kbd>I&nbsp;&nbsp;</kbd>(italic)
<br/>
<kbd>B&nbsp;&nbsp;</kbd>(bold)
<br/>
<kbd>BI&nbsp;</kbd>(bold italic)
</span>
or one of the 1&ndash;5 character fontstyles listed
<a href="#style-extensions">here</a>.
Thus, for the fonts Optima Light Italic and Optima Extra Black, your font names would be
<br/>
<span class="pre-in-pp">
  OptimaLI
  OptimaXBL
</span>
This scheme allows you to enter <kbd>.FAMILY&nbsp;Optima</kbd> to make
Optima the current family, and <kbd>.FT&nbsp;LI</kbd> or <kbd>.FT&nbsp;XBL</kbd>
when you need the fonts Light Italic or Extra Black.
</p>

<p>
Groff font names are, in fact, arbitrary; you can call your fonts
anything you like, provided the
<a href="#internal">internal name</a>
in the
<a href="#add">download file</a>
matches the internal name found in the groff font file.  When
calling a font that does not follow the recommended naming convention,
you must pass the full font name to <kbd>.FT</kbd> whenever you wish
to use it.
</p>

<p>
For example, the font, Goudy Stout, isn't really part of the
Goudy family, and while "stout" describes it, Stout is not a
recognized font style.  Therefore, its groff name could simply be
GoudyStout, and whenever you needed it, you could call it with
<kbd>.FT&nbsp;GoudyStout</kbd>.
</p>

<h3 id="install-font" class="docs appendices">Automate the whole process &ndash; the install-font script</h3>

<p>
A bash script to make the entire process of installing fonts a
painless no-brainer has been posted online at
<a href="http://www.schaffter.ca/mom/install-font">http://www.schaffter.ca/mom/install-font</a>.
Be sure to make the script executable
(<kbd>chmod 755 install-font</kbd>)
after you download it, then type <kbd>./install-font -H</kbd> for
usage.

<h2 id="codenotes" class="docs">Some reflections on mom</h2>

<p>
If, as Eric Raymond asserts, open source begins with a programmer
scratching a personal itch, then mom can truly be called open
source.
</p>

<p>
Mom had her origins in a library of groff routines I wrote over
the years to handle various aspects of typesetting and document
processing that weren&#8217;t adequately covered by ms, me, mm, and
friends.  Typically, I&#8217;d use the library to cobble together
macro sets for new challenges as they came my way.
</p>

<p>
As a writer living in a perpetual state of penury, all the computers
I&#8217;ve ever owned have been hand-me-downs&mdash;several
generations out-of-date and resource challenged.  Disk space has
always been an issue, as has processor speed and available RAM.  One
of the reasons I run GNU/Linux rather than the offering from Redmond
is that it has helped enormously to get the most out of my poor
little boxes.
</p>

<p>
In Linux-land (all Unix variants, in fact), the choice of
typesetting systems basically comes down to groff or TeX.  Both are
wonderful&mdash;monumental achievements if you ask me&mdash;and both
have their own particular strengths.  However, for people in my
financial position (and there are millions of us around the globe,
in both developed and developing countries), TeX and groff have one
big difference: size.  TeX is huge.  Even its most ardent supporters
agree it suffers from bloat, on top of being complex and unwieldy to
manage.  Groff is tiny by comparison, occupying minimal disk space
and having only a small memory footprint while at the same time
being flexible and powerful, typographically speaking.  Back in the
Jurassic Period, I ran it successfully on a 386 with 8 megs of RAM
and a 250 meg hard disk.
</p>

<p>
However, groff has always had a liability: it&#8217;s incredibly geeky.
Owing to its very long history, it&mdash;and its power users
&mdash;seem to have remained stuck in a time warp.  The canonical  macro packages
still look as they did back in those decades when memory was exorbitantly
expensive and every byte mattered.
</p>

<p>
For some time now, groff users and macro writers have had the option
to use &#8220;long&#8221; names for macros (i.e. longer than two
letters, the original limit), yet have mostly chosen not to.  With
long names, it&#8217;s possible to create macro sets that are
humanly readable and easy to interpret, encouraging development and
evolution.  What&#8217;s more, the macros themselves need not be
terse, intimidating, and easily forgotten 1- or 2-letter commands
inserted in the body of a document.  They can be sensible and
helpful to everyone, groff newbies and old hands alike.
</p>

<p>
Mom&#8217;s macro file, om.tmac, uses long names, aliases, and a
host of other groff goodies that have become part of the whole
groff picture under the unflagging guidance of groff&#8217;s
current maintainer, Werner Lemberg.  The function of nearly
every macro, number register and string can be infered simply
from its name.  The file is heavily commented.  A consistent, if
idiosyncratic, indenting style is used as well, significantly
improving readability.  Anyone wanting to futz around with
mom&#8217;s macros should be able to do so with a minimum of head
scratching.
</p>

<div class="box-tip">
<p class="tip">
<span class="note">Note:</span>
The main macro file, <strong>om.tmac</strong>, is stripped of
comments when groff is built from sources. <strong>om.tmac</strong>,
in the sources themselves, still contains the comments, as do the
tarballs posted on mom&#8217;s homepage.
