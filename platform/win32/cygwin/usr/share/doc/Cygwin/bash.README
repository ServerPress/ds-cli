bash 4.3.42-4
------------------------------------------
Bash is an sh-compatible shell that incorporates useful features from
the Korn shell (ksh) and C shell (csh).  It is intended to conform to
the IEEE POSIX P1003.2/ISO 9945.2 Shell and Tools standard.  It offers
functional improvements over sh for both programming and interactive
use. In addition, most sh scripts can be run by Bash without
modification.

As of July, 2005, bash is used as cygwin's /bin/sh.

This package includes all official upstream patches.

There are a few things you should be aware of before using this version:
1. When using binary mounts, cygwin programs try to emulate Linux.  Bash
on Linux does not understand \r\n line endings, but interprets the \r
literally, which leads to syntax errors or odd variable assignments.
Therefore, you will get the same behavior on Cygwin binary mounts by default.
2. d2u is your friend.  You can use it to convert any problematic script
into binary line endings.
3. Cygwin text mounts automatically work with either line ending style,
because the \r is stripped before bash reads the file.  If you absolutely
must use files with \r\n line endings, consider mounting the directory
where those files live as a text mount.  However, text mounts are not as
well tested or supported on the cygwin mailing list, so you may encounter
other problems with other cygwin tools in those directories.
4. This version of bash has a cygwin-specific set option, named "igncr",
to force bash to ignore \r, independently of cygwin's mount style.  As of
bash-3.2.3-5, it controls regular scripts, command substitution, and
sourced files.  I hope to convince the upstream bash maintainer to accept
this patch into a future bash release even on Linux, rather than keeping it
a cygwin-specific patch, but only time will tell.  There are several ways
to activate this option:
4a. For a single affected script, add this line just after the she-bang:
 (set -o igncr) 2>/dev/null && set -o igncr; # comment is needed
4b. For a single script, invoke bash explicitly with the option, as in
'bash -o igncr ./myscript' rather than the simpler './myscript'.
4c. To affect all scripts, export the environment variable BASH_ENV,
pointing to a file that sets the shell option as desired.  Bash will
source this file on startup for every script.
4d. Added in the bash-3.2-2 release: export the environment variable
SHELLOPTS with igncr included in it.  It is read-only from within bash,
but you can set it before invoking bash; once in bash, it auto-tracks the
current state of 'set -o igncr'.  If exported, then all bash child
processes inherit the same option settings; with the exception added in
3.2.9-11 that certain interactive options are not inherited in
non-interactive use.
4e. bash-4.1.9-1 dropped support for 'shopt -s igncr'; it did not make
sense to support the option through both set and shopt, and SHELLOPTS
proved to be more powerful.
5. You can also experiment with the IFS variable for controlling how bash
will treat \r during variable expansion.
6. There are varying levels of speed at which bash operates.  The fastest
is on a binary mount with igncr disabled (the default behavior).  Next
would be text mounts with igncr disabled and no \r in the underlying file.
Next would be binary mounts with igncr enabled.  And the slowest that bash
will operate is on text mounts with igncr enabled.
7. As additional cygwin extensions, this version of bash includes:
7a. EXECIGNORE - a colon-separated list of glob patterns to ignore
when completing on executables.  EXECIGNORE=*.dll is common.
7b. completion_strip_exe - using 'shopt -s completion_strip_exe'
makes completion strip .exe suffixes
8. This version of bash is immune to ShellShock (CVE-2014-6271 and
friends) because it exports functions via 'BASH_FUNC_foo%%=' rather than
'foo=' environment variables.  However, doing this has exposed weaknesses
in some other utilities like ksh or at that fail to scrub their
environment to exclude what is not a valid name for them.
9. If you don't like how bash behaves, then propose a patch, rather than
proposing idle ideas.  This turn of events has already been talked to
death on the mailing lists by people with many ideas, but few patches.

Switch to cygport build framework.  Simplify postinstall by assuming
that the old setup.exe 2.457.2.2 has been phased out.  Fix bug where

capture output better when run by setup.exe.

----- version 3.2.5-8 -- 2006-12-06 -----

exists on all cygwin installations.

----- version 3.2.3-5 -- 2006-11-02 -----
Make igncr also affect source built-in.  Include official upstream
patches 2 and 3.

----- version 3.2-4 -- 2006-10-24 -----
Make igncr also affect command substitution.  Rebuild against newer
libintl.

----- version 3.2-3 -- 2006-10-19 -----
Reinstate cygwin hack to make pipe(2) avoid stdin, stdout, and
stderr.  Otherwise, when invoked by a non-cygwin app, command
substitution could hang.

----- version 3.2-2 -- 2006-10-17 -----
Include official patch 1.  Take two at igncr in SHELLOPTS, since
previous try was dead-on-arrival.

----- version 3.2-1 -- 2006-10-16 -----
New upstream version.  Migrate igncr to a set -o option, so that it
can be inherited via SHELLOPTS.

----- version 3.1-9 -- 2006-10-02 -----
Two things to try to mitigate complaints on the list.  DOS paths are
now converted to POSIX paths before opening files, to honor mount
points no matter what.  A new shopt, igncr, is added that ignores \r
in binary mode scripts.

----- version 3.1-8 -- 2006-09-14 -----
The previous version failed to properly handle \r\n in text mounts,
due to lseek limitations.  This release allows either line ending in
text mounts, but follows Linux behavior on binary mounts.

----- version 3.1-7 -- 2006-09-08 -----
Kill crusty old CYGWIN-specific defines that were no longer applicable
and were causing severe slowdowns.  Reported in this thread:

----- version 3.1-3 -- 2006-03-03 -----
Incorporate upstream patches through patchlevel 11.  Fold in patches
through readline 5.1-4.  Touch up postinstall scripts to be tolerant
of reruns.

----- version 3.1-2 -- 2006-01-30 -----
Incorporate upstream patches through patchlevel 5.  Fix 'exec -l bash'
to be a login shell.  Apply hack from readline 5.1-2 for prompt display bug.

----- version 3.1-1 -- 2005-12-30 -----
New upstream release, through patchlevel 1.  Experimental release.

----- version 3.0-14 -- 2005-12-26 -----
Avoid realpath until cygwin 1.5.19 is out.

Fix bash_builtins man page.

----- version 3.0-12 -- 2005-08-30 -----
Improve postinstall to work with current setup.exe, and add a
profile.d script to try to ensure that /bin/sh exists even if
postinstall failed.  Improve cd -P to always work, and cd -L to work
better even in POSIX mode.

----- version 3.0-11 -- 2005-07-30 -----
Apply patch from bashdb for better debugger interaction.

----- version 3.0-10 -- 2005-07-27 -----
Disable spawnve patch; it broke interactive shell editing.  Fix name
parsing rules to accept a:\file as absolute, not relative.

----- version 3.0-9 -- 2005-07-22 -----
Fix postinstall script to not nuke sh.1.  Dynamically link against
readline again.  Apply patch from Keith Reynolds
(http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-bash/2005-07/msg00123.html)
that uses spawnve() where possible.

----- version 3.0-8 -- 2005-07-15 -----
Remove preremove script (it wasn't invoked by alternate name, and
invoking it by the name bash.sh would delete /bin/sh too early).  Fix
packaging bug that omitted info file, and add man pages for all
builtins not already claimed by programs.  As a temporary fix for
tilde expansion, don't link against libreadline, and add a hack that
tries to work around the extra space in prompt bug (this hack does not
fix the problem, but does mask the worst of it).

----- version 3.0-7 -- 2005-07-07 -----
Fix bug in postinstall script.

----- version 3.0-6 -- 2005-07-07 -----
Use cp, not ln, in the postinstall scripts since a running shell can't
break a hard link to itself in NTFS.

----- version 3.0-5 -- 2005-07-06 -----
Update the postinstall scripts to catch more cases, and provide sh man
page.

----- version 3.0-4 -- 2005-07-05 -----
Add a preremove script to counteract the postinstall script: delete
/bin/sh only if it matches /bin/bash.

----- version 3.0-3 -- 2005-07-02 -----
Fix a heap corruption bug introduced in the last build.  Enable
SSH_SOURCE_BASHRC.  Link to libreadline dynamically.  Use bash, not
ash, as /bin/sh.

----- version 3.0-2 -- 2005-05-27 -----
Fix some bugs with // completion, including an order of magnitude
speedup by avoiding stat("//server").  Link to libiconv dynamically
(but libreadline is still static until the // patches are applied
there, too).

----- version 3.0-1 -- 2005-05-25 -----
New upstream release, including the first 16 official patches.  New
maintainer, Eric Blake.  All patches in 2.05b-17 that were not
accepted upstream have been forward ported.

----- version 2.05b-17 -----
Applied a patch provided by Pierre Humblet, fixing the PID re-use issues,
originally reported in the thread "Bash returns incorrect process status".
The final patch applied has not been posted to cygwin@cygwin.com but closely
resembles the one posted in
	http://sources.redhat.com/ml/cygwin/2004-10/msg01093.html

--
Also applied a patch provided by Corinna Vinschen:

       * bashline.c (bash_directory_completion_hook): avoid turning '/' into
       '//' when converting/checking path

This patch specifically avoids a problem with tab-completion on some never-
released Cygwin versions (some snapshots between versions 1.5.9 and 1.5.10)
but more generally fixes a bug introducing ambiguity as to what directory to
open and search when asking for root.

----- version 2.05b-16 -----
Applied a patch provided by cgf:

	* subst.c (command_substitute): Guard against opening a pipe handle in
	stdin/stdout/stderr since they may be closed and keeping the pipe
	handle open in a subprocess will cause hangs.

----- version 2.05b-15 -----
Applied a temporary patch to fix the problem reported in
http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2003-09/msg00822.html

----- version 2.05b-14 -----
Additional canonical patches 5 through 7 applied

----- version 2.05b-13 and earlier -----
Earlier versions were maintained by Corinna Vinschen. The history may be found
in the cygwin-announce archives.
