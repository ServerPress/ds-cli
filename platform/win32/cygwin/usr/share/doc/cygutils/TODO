* Update (some?) utilities to handle unicode filenames, similar to
  IWAMURO Motonori's work on cygstart.

* This package doesn't really DO anything with the configure results.
  If certain libraries aren't found, then some programs shouldn't be
  built. Ditto certain functions.  But right now, everything that is
  needed is checked for in configure, but no adjustments are made
  to accomodate those results -- make will just fail.  This is surely
  not the right way to do things.

* What to do about wacky windows includes?  <shlobj.h> etc?
