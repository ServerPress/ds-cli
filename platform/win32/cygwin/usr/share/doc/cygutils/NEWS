1.4.15
  New maintainer Mark Geisert <mark@maxrnd.com>.
  Source code master converted from CVS to Git, still hosted at sourceware.
  * cygdrop: Replace strcmpi() calls with strcasecmp().
  * lpr: Replace stricmp() calls with strcasecmp().
  * mkshortcut: Fix seg fault due to freeing adjusted pointer.  Patch from
  reporter Anthony Heading.
  * mkshortcut: Handle changed Windows behavior when saving a link to a
  relative path; change evident after Windows 7.  Patch from reporter
  Anthony Heading.

1.4.14
  * cygdrop: Fix bug in obtaining security token information
  Patch from Corinna Vinschen, reported by Achim Gratz.
  * mkshortcut: Fix longstanding memory allocation bug (Patch
  by Jon Turney; reported by...practically everyone)

1.4.12
  * winln: new ln workalike that produces "native" windows
    shortcuts. Daniel Colascione.
  * Build fixes adapting to new w32api.
  * Bugfixes for lpr and readshortcut (already present in
    1.4.10-2 cygwin release).

1.4.10
  * getclip and putclip now support new cygwin-1.7.13+ clipboard format.
  * cygstart now supports file:// and mailto: URLs (Yaakov Selkowitz)
  * Added -R/--raw option to readshortcut (prevents expanding embedded
    environment variables within paths). Reported by Denis Excoffier.
  * mkshortcut and readshortcut now use cygwin-1.7 path conversion
    functions rather than deprecated ones. However, they make only
    minimal concessions to unicode, and operate mostly on narrow character
    encoded pathnames. They should now be able to handle "long" pathnames
    however.

1.4.8
  * Integrate cygstart with FD.o menu and mimetype system.
    (Yaakov Selkowitz)
  * Remove ascii utility; replaced by separate package derived
    from ESR's implementation http://catb.org/~esr/ascii/
  * Remove realpath utility; replaced by new implementation
    provided by coreutils (8.15 and above).

1.4.6
  * conv: no longer distribute as dos2unix, unix2dos, u2d, or d2u.
    Those programs now available from the separate dos2unix package.
  * ascii: by default, now only prints characters 0..127. Use new
    option --extended/-e for old behavior, printing characters 0..255.
    See this thread: http://cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2010-04/msg00600.html
  * cygstart: Fix --reference. Allow relative paths (enables, e.g.
    'cygstart calc'). Reported by Ken Hirsch.

  * Updated license for readshortcut to GPLv3+ (with permission
    from Rob Siklos)

    from Michael Schaap)
  * Updated license for cygdrop to GPLv3+ (was GPLv2+; no objections
    from Christian Franke)
  * Updated license for mkshortcut to GPLv3+ (was GPLv2+; no objections
    from Joshua Daniel Franklin)
  * Updated license for the cygicons.dll (as a collection) to GPLv3+ (was
    GPLv2+). Individual icons within the collection remain under their
    original license.
  * Updated license for banner to GPLv3+ (with permission from
    from Joerg Schaible)

1.4.4
  * Fix longstanding bug in mkshortcut, in which failure was
    reported even on success (Andy Koppe).
  * --help, --license, --usage, and --version output now goes
    to stdout instead of stderr
  * Add standard command line options to cygdrop (--version,
    --help, --license, --usage)
  * Various internal code cleanups

1.4.2
  Add hippo icon to cygicons.
  Fix mkshortcut bug.

1.4.1
  Add --help option to lpr.
  Build system improvements.
  Add support for building on MinGW.
  Add new cygdrop utility (Christian Franke; requires w2k or better)
  Many of the utilities have been relicensed as GPLv3+.

1.4.0
  Add support to cygstart for filenames with UTF/wide chars.
  (IWAMURO Motonori).

^^ Begin cygwin-1.7-specific development ^^ 

1.3.4
  Fix installation bug, exposed by new libtool's modified
  behavior (reported by Jerry Hedden and David Rothenberger)

1.3.3
  cygstart: Add new -w/--wait option (Barry Kelly)
            Propagate exit status of child process when -w (Alex Smith)

1.3.2
  cygicons: a new DLL that provides cygwin-related icons
            original images were obtained from various (free
            as in speech) sources.
  Now installs documentation into $(prefix)/share/doc/cygutils
  Also installs per-component documentation in $(docdir)/component/
  No longer link apps to libpopt if they don't need it.
  Needs libtool for building cygicons, but side effect is to use
    libtool throughout.  cygicons requires libtool to be configured
    with RC support (e.g. windres). This may break building on 
    non-w32 platforms.

1.3.1
  cygstart: compatibility fixes for recent cygwin snapshots
  build machinery updated to latest autotools -- now passes distcheck

  conv/d2u/u2d:  add --force/--safe options (defaults to safe).
     Identify binary files by presence of '\0' and bail if --safe.
     Do not short circuit if first line ends in target style; keep
     going.  Collapse sequences of '\r' without '\n' to a single
     EOL of target style.  '--force' propagates '\0' from input to
     output.

1.2.5:
  Add new -s (startup norm|max|min mode) option for 
    mkshortcut
