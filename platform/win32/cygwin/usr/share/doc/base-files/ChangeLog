Cygwin base system miscellaneous files
--------------------------------------
TODO:
-----
    * Should future versions relay in /etc/mkshrc to set PS1 properly for mksh
      if mksh supports sourcing /etc/mkshrc for interactive-login sessions?
    * Ask zsh mantainer to put /etc/zprofile and /etc/zshrc in place during
      installation.
    * Should users with GID 544 have /usr/bin/sbin in their paths?
    * Enhance admins' prompt (ideas include the known # sign and using another
      color, red?).

Change Log
----------
4.2-4 (bugfix release)
    * etc/postinstall/base-files-mketc.sh: Windows only uses 8 characters
      for files in the WINETC directory.  Check if the symlink target
      exists and remove the symlink if not (to fix "protocols" where
      "protocol" should be used).  Truncate the target file names to eight
      characters for new symlinks.  Reported by Walter L., see
      cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2015-09/msg00371.html
    * etc/defaults/etc/profile: Remove test for invalid user or group
      accounts and the instructions on how to create passwd and group file
      contents.

      cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-01/msg00201.html
    * Added two files under /etc/profile.d/ that use tzset, which
      uses the geographical location setting of the user to find the right
      mapping, rather than the locale setting. Only on Windows 2000 which
      doesn't know about the user's geographical location, or if fetching
      the geographical location fails, it falls back to the user's locale.
