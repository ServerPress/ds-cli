	GNU nano - an enhanced clone of the Pico text editor.

Overview

     The nano project was started because of a few "problems" with the
     wonderfully easy-to-use and friendly Pico text editor.

     First and foremost was its license: the Pine suite does not use
     the GPL or a GPL-friendly license, and has unclear restrictions on
     redistribution.  Because of this, Pine and Pico are not included
     with many GNU/Linux distributions.  Also, other features (like
     go-to-line-number or search-and-replace) were unavailable until
     recently or require a command-line flag.  Yuck.

     nano aims to solve these problems by emulating the functionality of
     Pico as closely as possible while addressing the problems above and
     providing other extra functionality.

     The nano editor is an official GNU package.  For more information on
     GNU and the Free Software Foundation, please see http://www.gnu.org/.

How to compile and install nano

     Download the nano source code, then:

     tar zxvf nano-x.y.z.tar.gz
     cd nano-x.y.z
     ./configure
     make
     make install

     It's that simple.  Use --prefix with configure to override the
     default installation directory of /usr/local.

     If you haven't configured with the "--disable-nanorc" option, after
     installation you may want to copy the doc/nanorc.sample to your
     home directory, rename it to ".nanorc", and then edit it according
     to your taste.

Mailing Lists and Bug Reports

	Savannah hosts all the nano-related mailing-lists.

	+ info-nano@gnu.org is a very low traffic list used to announce
	  new nano versions or other important information about the
	  project.
	+ help-nano@gnu.org is for those seeking to get help without
	  wanting to hear about the technical details of its development.
	+ nano-devel@gnu.org is the list used by the people that make
	  nano and a general development discussion list, with moderate
	  traffic.

	To subscribe, send email to <name>-request@gnu.org with a
	subject of "subscribe", where <name> is the list you want to
	subscribe to.

	For general bug reports, please file a description of the problem
	on the Savannah bug tracker page for nano
	(https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?group=nano).  The issue may have
	already been reported, and we are better able to track the state
	of the issue and whom to notify when fixed, the more the bug
	tracker is used.

Current Status

	GNU nano has reached its fifth stable milestone, 2.4.x.
	Development of new features will continue in the 2.5.x branch,
	while 2.4.x versions are dedicated to bug-fixing and polishing.
