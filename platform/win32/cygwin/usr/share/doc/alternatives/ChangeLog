Version 1.3.30c:
  - include missing man pages

Version 1.3.30b:
  - modified patch by Paul Sullivan for the maximum
    priority allowed in a level.  Configure script now
    tries to detect a 3-digit priority.
  - fixed alternatives /sbin path problem, per
    email from Mark Rosenstand.

Version 1.3.30a:
  - updated codebase to use Fedora Core 6's chkconfig-1.3.30
  - now includes "alternatives" program
  - added example in doc on using "--level" option,
    at Jari's suggestion.  It's already mentioned in
    the man-page, too.

Version 1.2.24h:
  - included patch made by Jonathan Cameron
    to add getopt_long support.  Altered a
    few points, and ported idea into ntsysv.
    Added configure support for detecting getopt_long.

Version 1.2.24g:
  - included patch made by Joe Balsama (and submitted by
    Mike Russos) to get the path right when a different
    init-dir is used.
  - added code to detect highest runlevel available on system
    and use that to limit symlinks, etc.
  - fixed up permissions of install scripts


Version 1.2.24f:
  - fixed bungled "--with-rcd-prefix".  Patch by Juerg Oehler.
  - replaced "--with-rcd-prefix" with two new options:
         "--with-rc-dir" and "--with-init-dir"
    to support other OSes which don't keep their init.d and rc.d
    directories together.
  - added new options to chkconfig:  --rc.d, --init.d, and --xinetd.d
    to mirror config options.  This allows a single executable
    to be used on multiple distributions, by using the ~/.popt
    file, eg:
        chkconfig alias --rocklinux --init.d /etc/init.d --rc.d /etc/init.d
        chkconfig alias --svr4      --init.d /etc/init.d --rc.d /etc
    (Suggested by Jeurg Oehler <oelers@bluewin.ch>.)

Version 1.2.24e:
  - corrected discrepency between configure help and implementation.
    Help described "--with-rcd-prefix" option, but code used "--with-rc-d".
    Changed to match usage described in help.  Reported
    by Juerg Oehler <oehlers@bluewin.ch>.
  - fixed up Makefiles for "intl" and "po" directories
    to respect the DESTDIR variable.  Reported by Juerg Oehler.

Version 1.2.24d:
  - more debian patching by Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@hungry.com>
    * Use the new configure option.
    * Correct the file extention to ignore, and complete the list.
    * New target 'debian-dist'
 
    * Updated the depend and conflicts section for the debian package.
      As long as this program updates the symlinks directly, instead of
      using the official Debian mechanism (a script called update-rc.d),
      it will be in conflict with file-rc.  The correct fix is to
      rewrite it to use this script when it updates the level status.


Version 1.2.24c:
  - Worked with code from Petter Reinholdtsen <pere@hungry.com>
    to add support for init scripts without chkconfig headers.
  - another Petter Reinholdtsen patch for debian packaging

Version 1.2.24b:
  - included Petter Reinholdtsen's patch for debian packaging

Version 1.2.24a:
  - updated codebase to RedHat's chkconfig-1.2.24 (included in redhat-7.2)

Version 1.2.16b:
  - added option to enable/disable ntsysv (which requires libnewt.a)
  - now checks for libnewt.a and disables ntsysv if not found

Version 1.2.16a:
  - updated codebase to RedHat's chkconfig-1.2.16

Version 1.0.7 - 1.0.8:
  - made changes to support "configure"
