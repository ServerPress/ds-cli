1.3.0 (2013-07-24)
	* Entirely refactored to use library routines from run2.
	* -wait need not be the first argument
	* New options --run-nogui, --run-notty, --run-verbose,
	  and --run-debug[=N] controlling how run.exe itself reports
	  error conditions and other messages.
	  + By default, it is silent. If any messages are enabled
	    via --run-verbose or --run-debug=N, then they will either
	    be reported on stderr, or in windows popup boxes.
	  + stderr is used if run.exe is launched from the cmdline, or
	    if --run-nogui.
	  + Windows popup boxes are used if run.exe is launched by
	    doubleclicking it or by a Windows shortcut, or if --run-notty.

1.2.0 (2013-05-30)
	* If cygwin, require at least cygwin-1.7
	* Support cygwin64 and mingw64.

1.1.13 (2011-01-25)
	* Ensure that stdout and stderr are distinct
	* Fix segfault in symlink name lookup
	* Remove ancient workarounds for cygwin B19 and B20: don't use
	  CYGWIN_CONV_* macros but instead call cygwin_conv_* functions
	  directly.
	* For cygwin-1.7, avoid deprecated cygwin_conv_* functions.
	  NOTE: Only the barest minimal changes were made, so (a) non-ascii
	  characters still not supported, and (b) long pathnames are not
	  yet supported. This will occur on the new 1.2 development stream.

1.1.12 (2009-08-18)
	* "Fix" 100% CPU usage problem reported with urxvt-X (at least, if
	  OS < Windows 7), by ensuring that W7 workaround is employed only
	  if OS is actually W7 or above, and
	* Logical refactoring:
	  - if $target is GUI, just launch it (don't worry about consoles)
	  - if a console is already present, ensure that $target's stdio
	    is connected to it, and launch $target.  This avoids extra
	    pipes, and some 100% CPU problems.
	  - Otherwise, create a new console and hide it (using various OS-
	    dependent techniques, incl. the W7 workaround), connect the
	    $target's stdio to it, and launch $target.

1.1.11 (2009-08-10)
	* New maintainer (Charles Wilson took over from Alexander Gottwald)
	* Updated build machinery
	* Added patch to support invisible consoles on Windows 7 (Corinna Vinschen)

1.1.10 (2006-05-22)
	* Create a real hidden console

1.1.9 (2006-04-06)
	* Remove quotes from search path. Fixes problem with spaces in filenames

1.1.8 (2006-03-31)
	* Remove quotes from exename. Fixes problem with spaces in filenames

1.1.7 (2006-03-08)
	* Copy cygwin environment variables to windows environment
	* Disable WinMainCRTStartup wrapper

1.1.6 (2005-11-09)
	* The order of icons has been adjusted so the X is now at index 2
	  again and X-start-menu-icons should display right.
	* Manpage added

1.1.5 (2005-11-26)
	* original standalong package for the run utility, extracted
	  from the cygwin X-startup-scripts package.
