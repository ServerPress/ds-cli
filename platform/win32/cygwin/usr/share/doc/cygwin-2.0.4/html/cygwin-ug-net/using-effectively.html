Cygwin is not a full operating system, and so must rely on Windows for
accomplishing some tasks. For example, Cygwin provides a POSIX view
of the Windows filesystem, but does not provide filesystem drivers of 
its own. Therefore part of using Cygwin effectively is learning to use
Windows effectively. 
Many Windows utilities provide a good way to interact with Cygwin's 
predominately command-line environment. For example, 
<span class="command"><strong>ipconfig.exe</strong></span> provides information about network 
configuration, and <span class="command"><strong>net.exe</strong></span> views and configures
network file and printer resources.  Most of these tools
support the <code class="literal">/?</code> switch to display usage information. 
</p><p>
Unfortunately, no standard set of tools included with all versions of 
Windows exists.  Generally, the younger the Windows version, the more
complete are the on-board tools.  Microsoft also provides free downloads
for Windows XP (the Windows Support Tools).  Additionally, many independent
sites such as 
<a class="ulink" href="http://download.com" target="_top">download.com</a>, 
<a class="ulink" href="http://simtel.net" target="_top">simtel.net</a>, 
and Microsoft's own
<a class="ulink" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/default.aspx" target="_top">Sysinternals</a>
provide quite useful command-line utilities, as far as they are not
already provided by Cygwin.  A few Windows tools, such as 
<span class="command"><strong>find.exe</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>link.exe</strong></span> and
<span class="command"><strong>sort.exe</strong></span>, may conflict with the Cygwin versions
make sure that you use the full path (<span class="command"><strong>/usr/bin/find</strong></span>)
or that your Cygwin <code class="literal">bin</code> directory comes first in your
<code class="envar">PATH</code>.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-pathnames-effectively"></a>Pathnames</h3></div></div></div><p>
Windows programs do not understand POSIX pathnames, so any arguments 
that reference the filesystem must be in Windows (or DOS) format or 
translated.  Cygwin provides the <span class="command"><strong>cygpath</strong></span> utility for 
converting between Windows and POSIX paths. A complete description of its 
options and examples of its usage are in <a class="xref" href="using-utils.html#cygpath" title="cygpath">the section called “cygpath”</a>, 
including a shell script for starting Windows Explorer in any directory. 
The same format works for most Windows programs, for example 
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="literal">notepad.exe "$(cygpath -aw "Desktop/Phone Numbers.txt")"</code>
</pre><p>
A few programs require a Windows-style, semicolon-delimited path list, 
which <span class="command"><strong>cygpath</strong></span> can translate from a POSIX path with the
<code class="literal">-p</code> option. For example, a Java compilation from 
<span class="command"><strong>bash</strong></span> might look like this: 
</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="literal">javac -cp "$(cygpath -pw "$CLASSPATH")" hello.java</code>
</pre><p>
Since using quoting and subshells is somewhat awkward, it is often 
preferable to use <span class="command"><strong>cygpath</strong></span> in shell scripts.

Many popular Cygwin packages, such as <code class="systemitem">ncftp</code>, 
<code class="systemitem">lynx</code>, and <code class="systemitem">wget</code>, require a 
network connection.  Since Cygwin relies on Windows for connectivity, 
if one of these tools is not working as expected you may need to 
troubleshoot using Windows tools. The first test is to see if you
can reach the URL's host with <span class="command"><strong>ping.exe</strong></span>, one of the 
few utilities included with every Windows version since Windows 95.
If you chose to install the <code class="systemitem">inetutils</code> package, 
you may have both
Windows and Cygwin versions of utilities such as <span class="command"><strong>ftp</strong></span>
and <span class="command"><strong>telnet</strong></span>. If you are having problems using one
of these programs, see if the alternate one works as expected. 
</p><p>
There are a variety of other programs available for specific situations.
If your system does not have an always-on network connection, you 
may be interested in <span class="command"><strong>rasdial.exe</strong></span> for automating dialup
connections.  
Users who frequently change their network 
configuration can script these changes with <span class="command"><strong>netsh.exe</strong></span>.
For proxy users, the open source 
<a class="ulink" href="http://apserver.sourceforge.net" target="_top">
NTLM Authorization Proxy Server</a> or the no-charge
<a class="ulink" href="http://www.hummingbird.com/products/nc/socks/index.html" target="_top">
Hummingbird SOCKS Proxy</a> may allow you to use Cygwin network
programs in your environment.
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-cygutils"></a>The cygutils package</h3></div></div></div><p>
The optional <code class="systemitem">cygutils</code> package contains
miscellaneous tools that are small enough to not require their own package.
It is not included in a default Cygwin install; select it from the Utils
category in <span class="command"><strong>setup.exe</strong></span>. Several of the
<code class="systemitem">cygutils</code> tools are useful for interacting with
Windows.</p><p>
One of the hassles of Unix-Windows interoperability is the different line 
endings on text files.  As mentioned in <a class="xref" href="using-textbinary.html" title="Text and Binary modes">the section called “Text and Binary modes”</a>, 
Unix tools such as <span class="command"><strong>tr</strong></span> can convert between CRLF and LF 
endings, but <code class="systemitem">cygutils</code> provides several dedicated programs: 
<span class="command"><strong>conv</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>d2u</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>dos2unix</strong></span>, 
<span class="command"><strong>u2d</strong></span>, and <span class="command"><strong>unix2dos</strong></span>. Use the
<code class="literal">--help</code> switch for usage information. 
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-shortcuts"></a>Creating shortcuts with cygutils</h3></div></div></div><p>
Another problem area is between Unix-style links, which link one file
to another, and Microsoft .lnk files, which provide a shortcut to a
file.  They seem similar at first glance but, in reality, are fairly 
different.  By default, Cygwin does not create symlinks as .lnk files,
but there's an option to do that, see <a class="xref" href="using-cygwinenv.html" title="The CYGWIN environment variable">the section called “The <code class="envar">CYGWIN</code> environment
variable”</a>.
These symlink .lnk files are compatible with Windows-created .lnk files,
but they are still different.  They do not include much of the information
that is available in a standard Microsoft shortcut, such as the working
directory, an icon, etc.  The <code class="systemitem">cygutils</code>
package includes a <span class="command"><strong>mkshortcut</strong></span> utility for creating
standard native Microsoft .lnk files.
</p><p>
But here's the problem.  If Cygwin handled these native shortcuts like any
other symlink, you could not archive Microsoft .lnk files into
<span class="command"><strong>tar</strong></span> archives and keep all the information in them. 
After unpacking, these shortcuts would have lost all the extra information
and would be no different than standard Cygwin symlinks. Therefore these two
types of links are treated differently.  Unfortunately, this means that the 
usual Unix way of creating and using symlinks does not work with native
Windows shortcuts. 
</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="using-printing"></a>Printing with cygutils</h3></div></div></div><p>
There are several options for printing from Cygwin, including the 
<span class="command"><strong>lpr</strong></span> found in <code class="systemitem">cygutils</code> (not to be confused with the 
native Windows <span class="command"><strong>lpr.exe</strong></span>). The easiest way to use <code class="systemitem">cygutils</code>' 
<span class="command"><strong>lpr</strong></span> is to specify a default device name in the 
<code class="envar">PRINTER</code> environment variable.  You may also specify a device 
on the command line with the <code class="literal">-d</code> or <code class="literal">-P</code> 
options, which will override the environment variable setting. 
</p><p>
A device name 
may be a UNC path (<code class="literal">\\server_name\printer_name</code>), a reserved 
DOS device name (<code class="literal">prn</code>, <code class="literal">lpt1</code>), or a 
local port name that is mapped to a printer share. Note that forward slashes 
may be used in a UNC path (<code class="literal">//server_name/printer_name</code>),
which is helpful when using <span class="command"><strong>lpr</strong></span> from a shell that uses
the backslash as an escape character. 
</p><p>
<span class="command"><strong>lpr</strong></span> sends raw data to the printer; no formatting is done.
Many, but not all, printers accept plain text as input. If your printer 
supports PostScript, packages such as 
<code class="systemitem">a2ps</code> and <code class="systemitem">enscript</code> can prepare 
text files for printing. The <code class="systemitem">ghostscript</code> package also 
provides some translation
from PostScript to various native printer languages. Additionally, a native 
Windows application for printing PostScript, <span class="command"><strong>gsprint</strong></span>, is 
available from the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/" target="_top">Ghostscript
website</a>.
