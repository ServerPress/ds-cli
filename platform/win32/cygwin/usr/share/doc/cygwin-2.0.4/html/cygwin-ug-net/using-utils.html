    example, <code class="literal">--help</code> and <code class="literal">-h</code> function
    identically. All of the Cygwin command-line utilities support the

       cygcheck --show-unique-object-names Cygwin-DLL
       cygcheck -h

List system information, check installed packages, or query package database.

At least one command option or a PROGRAM is required, as shown above.

  PROGRAM              list library (DLL) dependencies of PROGRAM
  -c, --check-setup    show installed version of PACKAGE and verify integrity
                       (or for all installed packages if none specified)
  -d, --dump-only      just list packages, do not verify (with -c)
  -s, --sysinfo        produce diagnostic system information (implies -c -d)
  -r, --registry       also scan registry for Cygwin settings (with -s)
  -k, --keycheck       perform a keyboard check session (must be run from a
                       plain console only, not from a pty/rxvt/xterm)
  -f, --find-package   find the package to which FILE belongs
  -l, --list-package   list contents of PACKAGE (or all packages if none given)
  -p, --package-query  search for REGEXP in the entire cygwin.com package
                       repository (requires internet connectivity)
  --delete-orphaned-installation-keys
                       Delete installation keys of old, now unused
                       installations from the registry.  Requires the right
                       to change the registry.
  --enable-unique-object-names Cygwin-DLL
  --disable-unique-object-names Cygwin-DLL
  --show-unique-object-names Cygwin-DLL
                       Enable, disable, or show the setting of the
                       \"unique object names\" setting in the Cygwin DLL
                       given as argument to this option.  The DLL path must
                       be given as valid Windows(!) path.
                       See the users guide for more information.
                       If you don't know what this means, don't change it.
  -v, --verbose        produce more verbose output
  -h, --help           annotate output with explanatory comments when given
                       with another command, otherwise print this help
  -V, --version        print the version of cygcheck and exit

Note: -c, -f, and -l only report on packages that are currently installed. To
  search all official Cygwin packages use -p instead.  The -p REGEXP matches
  package names, descriptions, and names of files/paths within all packages.
</pre><p> The <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> program is a diagnostic utility for
      dealing with Cygwin programs. If you are familiar with
      <span class="command"><strong>dpkg</strong></span> or <span class="command"><strong>rpm</strong></span>,
      <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> is similar in many ways. (The major
      difference is that <span class="command"><strong>setup.exe</strong></span> handles installing and
      uninstalling packages; see <a class="xref" href="setup-net.html#internet-setup" title="Internet Setup">the section called “Internet Setup”</a> for more
      information.) </p><p> The <code class="literal">-c</code> option checks the version and status of
      installed Cygwin packages. If you specify one or more package names,
      <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> will limit its output to those packages, or
      with no arguments it lists all packages. A package will be marked
      <code class="literal">Incomplete</code> if files originally installed are no longer
      present. The best thing to do in that situation is reinstall the package
      with <span class="command"><strong>setup.exe</strong></span>. To see which files are missing, use
      the <code class="literal">-v</code> option. If you do not need to know the status
      of each package and want <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> to run faster, add
      the <code class="literal">-d</code> option and <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> will
      only output the name and version for each package. </p><p> If you list one or more programs on the command line,
      <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> will diagnose the runtime environment of that
      program or programs, providing the names of DLL files on which the
      program depends. If you specify the <code class="literal">-s</code> option,
      <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> will give general system information. If you
      list one or more programs on the command line and specify
      <code class="literal">-s</code>, <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> will report on
      both.</p><p> The <code class="literal">-f</code> option helps you to track down which
      package a file came from, and <code class="literal">-l</code> lists all files in a
      package. For example, to find out about
      <code class="filename">/usr/bin/less</code> and its package: </p><div class="example"><a name="utils-cygcheck-ex"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.3. Example <span class="command">cygcheck</span>
      usage</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">
$ cygcheck -f /usr/bin/less
less-381-1

$ cygcheck -l less
/usr/bin/less.exe
/usr/bin/lessecho.exe
/usr/bin/lesskey.exe
/usr/man/man1/less.1
/usr/man/man1/lesskey.1
</pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break"> </p><p>The <code class="literal">-h</code> option prints additional helpful messages
      in the report, at the beginning of each section. It also adds table
      column headings. While this is useful information, it also adds some to
      the size of the report, so if you want a compact report or if you know
      what everything is already, just leave this out.</p><p>The <code class="literal">-v</code> option causes the output to be more
      verbose. What this means is that additional information will be reported
      which is usually not interesting, such as the internal version numbers of
      DLLs, additional information about recursive DLL usage, and if a file in
      one directory in the PATH also occurs in other directories on the PATH. </p><p>The <code class="literal">-r</code> option causes <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span>
      to search your registry for information that is relevant to Cygwin
      programs. These registry entries are the ones that have "Cygwin" in the
      name. If you are paranoid about privacy, you may remove information from
      this report, but please keep in mind that doing so makes it harder to
      diagnose your problems.</p><p>In contrast to the other options that search the packages that are
      installed on your local system, the <code class="literal">-p</code> option can be
      used to search the entire official Cygwin package repository. It takes as
      argument a Perl-compatible regular expression which is used to match
      package names, package descriptions, and path/filenames of the contents
      of packages. This feature requires an active internet connection, since
      it must query the <code class="literal">cygwin.com</code> web site. In fact, it is
      equivalent to the search that is available on the <a class="ulink" href="https://cygwin.com/packages/" target="_top">Cygwin package listing</a>
      page.</p><p>For example, perhaps you are getting an error because you are missing
      a certain DLL and you want to know which package includes that file:
      </p><div class="example"><a name="utils-search-ex"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.4. Searching all packages for a

</pre></div></div><p><br class="example-break"> </p><p>Note that this option takes a regular expression, not a glob or
      wildcard. This means that you need to use <code class="literal">.*</code> if you
      want something similar to the wildcard <code class="literal">*</code> commonly used
      in filename globbing. Similarly, to match the period character you should
      use <code class="literal">\.</code> since the <code class="literal">.</code> character in a
      regexp is a metacharacter that will match any character. Also be aware
      that the characters such as <code class="literal">\</code> and <code class="literal">*</code>
      are shell metacharacters, so they must be either escaped or quoted, as in
      the example above.</p><p>The third example above illustrates that if you want to match a whole
      filename, you should include the <code class="literal">/</code> path seperator. In
      the given example this ensures that filenames that happen to end in
      <code class="literal">ls.exe</code> such as <code class="literal">ncftpls.exe</code> are not
      shown. Note that this use does not mean "look for packages with
      <code class="literal">ls</code> in the root directory," since the
      <code class="literal">/</code> can match anywhere in the path. It's just there to
      anchor the match so that it matches a full filename.</p><p>By default the matching is case-sensitive. To get a case insensitive
      match, begin your regexp with <code class="literal">(?i)</code> which is a
      PCRE-specific feature. For complete documentation on Perl-compatible
      regular expression syntax and options, read the <span class="command"><strong>perlre</strong></span>
      manpage, or one of many websites such as <code class="literal">perldoc.com</code>
      that document the Perl language.</p><p>The <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> program should be used to send
      information about your system for troubleshooting when requested. When
      asked to run this command save the output so that you can email it, for
      example:</p><pre class="screen">
<code class="prompt">$</code> <strong class="userinput"><code>cygcheck -s -v -r -h &gt; cygcheck_output.txt</code></strong>
</pre><p> Each Cygwin DLL stores its path and installation key in the
      registry. This allows troubleshooting of problems which could be a result
      of having multiple concurrent Cygwin installations. However, if you're
      experimenting a lot with different Cygwin installation paths, your
      registry could accumulate a lot of old Cygwin installation entries for
      which the installation doesn't exist anymore. To get rid of these
      orphaned registry entries, use the <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck
      --delete-orphaned-installation-keys</strong></span> command.</p><p> Each Cygwin DLL generates a key value from its installation path.
      This value is not only stored in the registry, it's also used to generate
      global object names used for interprocess communication. This keeps
      different Cygwin installations separate. Processes running under a Cygwin
      DLL installed in C:\cygwin don't see processes running under a Cygwin DLL
      installed in C:\Program Files\cygwin. This allows running multiple
      versions of Cygwin DLLs without these versions to interfere with each
      other, or to run small third-party installations for a specific purpose
      independently from a Cygwin net distribution. </p><p> For debugging purposes it could be desired that the various Cygwin
      DLLs use the same key, independently from their installation paths. If
      the DLLs have different versions, trying to run processes under these
      DLLs concurrently will result in error messages like this one:</p><pre class="screen">
*** shared version mismatch detected - 0x8A88009C/0x75BE0074.
This problem is probably due to using incompatible versions of the Cygwin DLL.
Search for cygwin1.dll using the Windows Start-&gt;Find/Search facility
and delete all but the most recent version.  The most recent version *should*
reside in x:\\cygwin\\bin, where 'x' is the drive on which you have
installed the cygwin distribution.  Rebooting is also suggested if you
are unable to find another Cygwin DLL.
</pre><p> To disable the usage of a unique key value of a certain Cygwin DLL,
      use the <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck --disable-unique-object-names
      Cygwin-DLL</strong></span> command. <code class="literal">Cygwin-DLL</code> is the
      Windows path (*not* a Cygwin POSIX path) to the DLL for which you want to
      disable this feature. Note that you have to stop all Cygwin processes
      running under this DLL, before you're allowed to change this setting. For
      instance, run <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck</strong></span> from a DOS command line for
      this purpose.</p><p>To re-enable the usage of a unique key, use the <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck
      --enable-unique-object-names Cygwin-DLL</strong></span> command. This option
      has the same characteristics as the
      <code class="literal">--disable-unique-object-names</code> option</p><p>Finally, you can use <span class="command"><strong>cygcheck --show-unique-object-names
      Cygwin-DLL</strong></span> to find out if the given Cygwin DLL use unique
      object names or not. In contrast to the <code class="literal">--disable-...</code>
      and <code class="literal">--enable-...</code> options, the
      <code class="literal">--show-unique-object-names</code> option also works for
      Cygwin DLLs which are currently in use.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="cygpath"></a>cygpath</h3></div></div></div><pre class="screen">

</pre><p>The <span class="command"><strong>cygpath</strong></span> program is a utility that converts
      Windows native filenames to Cygwin POSIX-style pathnames and vice versa.
      It can be used when a Cygwin program needs to pass a file name to a
      native Windows program, or expects to get a file name from a native
      Windows program. Alternatively, <span class="command"><strong>cygpath</strong></span> can output
      information about the location of important system directories in either
      format. </p><p>The <code class="literal">-u</code> and <code class="literal">-w</code> options indicate
      whether you want a conversion to UNIX (POSIX) format
      (<code class="literal">-u</code>) or to Windows format (<code class="literal">-w</code>). Use
      the <code class="literal">-d</code> to get DOS-style (8.3) file and path names. The
      <code class="literal">-m</code> option will output Windows-style format but with
      forward slashes instead of backslashes. This option is especially useful
      in shell scripts, which use backslashes as an escape character.</p><p> In combination with the <code class="literal">-w</code> option, you can use
      the <code class="literal">-l</code> and <code class="literal">-s</code> options to use normal
      (long) or DOS-style (short) form. The <code class="literal">-d</code> option is
      identical to <code class="literal">-w</code> and <code class="literal">-s</code> together. </p><p>The <code class="literal">-C</code> option allows to specify a Windows codepage
      to print DOS and Windows paths created with one of the
      <code class="literal">-d</code>, <code class="literal">-m</code>, or <code class="literal">-w</code>
      options. The default is to use the character set of the current locale
      defined by one of the internationalization environment variables
      <code class="envar">LC_ALL</code>, <code class="envar">LC_CTYPE</code>, or <code class="envar">LANG</code>,
      see <a class="xref" href="setup-locale.html" title="Internationalization">the section called “Internationalization”</a>. This is sometimes not sufficient for
      interaction with native Windows tools, which might expect native,
      non-ASCII characters in a specific Windows codepage. Console tools, for
      instance, might expect pathnames in the current OEM codepage, while
      graphical tools like Windows Explorer might expect pathnames in the
      current ANSI codepage.</p><p>The <code class="literal">-C</code> option takes a single parameter:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist compact" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p><code class="literal">ANSI</code>, to specify the current ANSI

      <span class="command"><strong>dumper</strong></span> is to plug it into cygwin's Just-In-Time
      debugging facility by adding
      </p><pre class="screen">
error_start=x:\path\to\dumper.exe
</pre><p> to the
      <span class="emphasis"><em>CYGWIN</em></span> environment variable. Please note that
      <code class="literal">x:\path\to\dumper.exe</code> is Windows-style and not cygwin
      path. If <code class="literal">error_start</code> is set this way, then dumper will
      be started whenever some program encounters a fatal error. </p><p> <span class="command"><strong>dumper</strong></span> can be also be started from the command
      line to create a core dump of any running process. Unfortunately, because
      of a Windows API limitation, when a core dump is created and
      <span class="command"><strong>dumper</strong></span> exits, the target process is terminated too. </p><p> To save space in the core dump, <span class="command"><strong>dumper</strong></span> doesn't
      write those portions of target process' memory space that are loaded from
      executable and dll files and are unchangeable, such as program code and
      debug info. Instead, <span class="command"><strong>dumper</strong></span> saves paths to files which
      contain that data. When a core dump is loaded into gdb, it uses these
      paths to load appropriate files. That means that if you create a core
      dump on one machine and try to debug it on another, you'll need to place
      identical copies of the executable and dlls in the same directories as on
      the machine where the core dump was created. </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="getconf"></a>getconf</h3></div></div></div><pre class="screen">

      specify where the information comes from, some domain, or the local SAM
      of a machine. Note that you can only enumerate accounts from trusted
      domains.  Any non-trusted domain will be ignored.  Access-restrictions
      of your current account apply.  The <code class="literal">-l/-L</code> when used
      with a machine name, tries to contact that machine to enumerate local
      groups of other machines, typically outside of domains.  This scenario
      cannot be covered by Cygwin's account automatism.  If you want to use

</pre><p>The <span class="command"><strong>mkpasswd</strong></span> program can be used to create a
      <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code> file.  Cygwin doesn't need this file,
      because it reads user information from the Windows account databases,
      but you can add an <code class="filename">/etc/passwd</code> file, for instance
      if your machine is often disconnected from its domain controller.</p><p>Note that this information is static, in contrast to the information
      automatically gathered by Cygwin from the Windows account databases. If
      you change the user information on your system, you'll need to regenerate
      the passwd file for it to have the new information.</p><p>By default, the information generated by <span class="command"><strong>mkpasswd</strong></span>
      is equivalent to the information generated by Cygwin itself.  The
      <code class="literal">-d</code> and <code class="literal">-l/-L</code> options allow you to
      specify where the information comes from, some domain, or the local SAM
      of a machine.  Note that you can only enumerate accounts from trusted
      domains.  Any non-trusted domain will be ignored.  Access-restrictions
      of your current account apply.  The <code class="literal">-l/-L</code> when used
      with a machine name, tries to contact that machine to enumerate local
      groups of other machines, typically outside of domains.  This scenario
      cannot be covered by Cygwin's account automatism.  If you want to use
      the <code class="literal">-L</code> option, but you don't like the default
      domain/group separator from <code class="filename">/etc/nsswitch.conf</code>,
      you can specify another separator using the <code class="literal">-S</code> option,
      analog to <span class="command"><strong>mkgroup</strong></span>.</p><p>For very simple needs, an entry for the current user can be created
      by using the option <code class="literal">-c</code>.</p><p>The <code class="literal">-o</code> option allows for special cases (such as
      multiple domains) where the UIDs might match otherwise. The
      <code class="literal">-p</code> option causes <span class="command"><strong>mkpasswd</strong></span> to use
      the specified prefix instead of the account home dir or <code class="literal">/home/

  cygexec    - Treat all files below mount point as cygwin executables.
  dos        - Always convert leading spaces and trailing dots and spaces to
	       characters in the UNICODE private use area.  This allows to use
	       broken filesystems which only allow DOS filenames, even if they
	       are not recognized as such by Cygwin.
  exec       - Treat all files below mount point as executable.

        from a particular Win32 path to a POSIX one, Cygwin will, instead,
        convert to a POSIX path using a default mount point:
        <code class="filename">/cygdrive</code>. For example, if Cygwin accesses
        <code class="filename">z:\foo</code> and the z drive is not currently in the
        mount table, then <code class="filename">z:\</code> will be accessible as
        <code class="filename">/cygdrive/z</code>. The <span class="command"><strong>mount</strong></span> utility
        can be used to change this default automount prefix through the use of
        the "--change-cygdrive-prefix" option. In the following example, we
        will set the automount prefix to <code class="filename">/mnt</code>:</p><div class="example"><a name="utils-cygdrive-ex"></a><p class="title"><b>Example 3.11. Changing the default prefix</b></p><div class="example-contents"><pre class="screen">

        precedence over the system-wide setting. The <span class="command"><strong>mount</strong></span>
        utility creates system-wide mounts by default if you do not specify a
        type. You can always see the user and system cygdrive prefixes with the

        pathnames that do not start with "/", there is no way to make use of
        such mount points.</p><p>Normally the POSIX mount point in Cygwin is an existing empty
        directory, as in standard UNIX. If this is the case, or if there is a
        place-holder for the mount point (such as a file, a symbolic link
        pointing anywhere, or a non-empty directory), you will get the expected
        behavior. Files present in a mount point directory before the mount
        become invisible to Cygwin programs. </p><p>It is sometimes desirable to mount to a non-existent directory, for
        example to avoid cluttering the root directory with names such as
        <code class="filename">a</code>, <code class="filename">b</code>, <code class="filename">c</code>
        pointing to disks. Although <span class="command"><strong>mount</strong></span> will give you a
        warning, most everything will work properly when you refer to the mount
        point explicitly. Some strange effects can occur however. For example
        if your current working directory is <code class="filename">/dir</code>, say,
        and <code class="filename">/dir/mtpt</code> is a mount point, then

      <span class="command"><strong>passwd</strong></span> to perform several account maintenance
      functions (users may perform some of these functions on their own
      accounts). Accounts may be locked with the <code class="literal">-l</code> flag and
      unlocked with the <code class="literal">-u</code> flag. Similarly,
      <code class="literal">-c</code> disables a user's ability to change passwords, and
      <code class="literal">-C</code> allows a user to change passwords. For password
      expiry, the <code class="literal">-e</code> option disables expiration, while the
      <code class="literal">-E</code> option causes the password to expire according to
      the system's normal aging rules. Use <code class="literal">-p</code> to disable the

      <code class="literal">-L</code> options. The <code class="literal">-i</code> option is used

      days. After a user account has had an expired password for
      <span class="emphasis"><em>NUM</em></span> days, the user may no longer sign on to the

      permitted to change the password until <span class="emphasis"><em>MINDAYS</em></span> days
      have elapsed. The <code class="literal">-x</code> option is used to set the maximum
      number of days a password remains valid. After
      <span class="emphasis"><em>MAXDAYS</em></span> days, the password is required to be
      changed. Allowed values for the above options are 0 to 999. The
      <code class="literal">-L</code> option sets the minimum length of allowed passwords
      for users who don't belong to the administrators group to
      <span class="emphasis"><em>LEN</em></span> characters. Allowed values for the minimum

      means `no restrictions'.</p><p> All operations affecting the current user are by default run against
      the logon server of the current user (taken from the environment variable
      <code class="envar">LOGONSERVER</code>. When password or account information of other
      users should be changed, the logon server is evaluated automatically.
      In rare cases, it might be necessary to switch to another domain
      controller to perform the action.  In this case, use the
      <code class="literal">-d</code> option to specify the machine to run the command
      against. Note that the current user must have account operator permissions
      to perform user account changes in a domain. </p><p>Users can use the <span class="command"><strong>passwd -R</strong></span> to enter a password
      which then gets stored in a special area of the registry on the local
      system, which is also used by Windows to store passwords of accounts
      running Windows services. When a privileged Cygwin application calls the
      <span class="command"><strong>set{e}uid(user_id)</strong></span> system call, Cygwin checks if a
      password for that user has been stored in this registry area. If so, it
      uses this password to switch to this user account using that password.
      This allows you to logon through, for instance, <span class="command"><strong>ssh</strong></span>

You can use forward slash ('/') as a separator instead of backslash, in
that case backslash is treated as escape character
Example: regtool.exe get '\user\software\Microsoft\Clock\iFormat'
</pre><p>The <span class="command"><strong>regtool</strong></span> program allows shell scripts to access
      and modify the Windows registry. Note that modifying the Windows registry
      is dangerous, and carelessness here can result in an unusable system. Be
      careful.</p><p>The <code class="literal">-v</code> option means "verbose". For most commands,
      this causes additional or lengthier messages to be printed. Conversely,
      the <code class="literal">-q</code> option supresses error messages, so you can use
      the exit status of the program to detect if a key exists or not (for
      example).</p><p>The <code class="literal">-w</code> option allows you to access the 64 bit view
      of the registry. Several subkeys exist in a 32 bit and a 64 bit version
      when running on Windows 64. Since Cygwin is running in 32 bit mode, it
      only has access to the 32 bit view of these registry keys. When using the
      <code class="literal">-w</code> switch, the 64 bit view is used and
      <span class="command"><strong>regtool</strong></span> can access the entire registry. This option is
      simply ignored when running on 32 bit Windows versions. </p><p>The <code class="literal">-W</code> option allows you to access the 32 bit view
      on the registry. The purpose of this option is mainly for symmetry. It
      permits creation of OS agnostic scripts which would also work in a
      hypothetical 64 bit version of Cygwin.</p><p>You must provide <span class="command"><strong>regtool</strong></span> with an
      <span class="emphasis"><em>action</em></span> following options (if any). Currently, the
      action must be <code class="literal">add</code>, <code class="literal">set</code>,
      <code class="literal">check</code>, <code class="literal">get</code>,
      <code class="literal">list</code>, <code class="literal">remove</code>,
      <code class="literal">set</code>, or <code class="literal">unset</code>. </p><p>The <code class="literal">add</code> action adds a new key. The
      <code class="literal">check</code> action checks to see if a key exists (the exit
      code of the program is zero if it does, nonzero if it does not). The
      <code class="literal">get</code> action gets the value of a key, and prints it (and
      nothing else) to stdout. Note: if the value doesn't exist, an error
      message is printed and the program returns a non-zero exit code. If you
      give <code class="literal">-q</code>, it doesn't print the message but does return
      the non-zero exit code.</p><p> The <code class="literal">list</code> action lists the subkeys and values
      belonging to the given key. With <code class="literal">list</code>, the
      <code class="literal">-k</code> option instructs <span class="command"><strong>regtool</strong></span> to
      print only KEYs, and the <code class="literal">-l</code> option to print only
      VALUEs. The <code class="literal">-p</code> option postfixes a
      <code class="literal">'/'</code> to each KEY, but leave VALUEs with no postfix. The
      <code class="literal">remove</code> action removes a key. Note that you may need to
      remove everything in the key before you may remove it, but don't rely on
      this stopping you from accidentally removing too much. </p><p>The <code class="literal">get</code> action prints a value within a key. With
      the <code class="literal">-b</code> option, data is printed as hex bytes.
      <code class="literal">-n</code> allows to print the data as a typeless stream of
      bytes. Integer values (REG_DWORD, REG_QWORD) are usually printed as
      decimal values. The <code class="literal">-x</code> option allows to print the
      numbers as hexadecimal values.</p><p>The <code class="literal">set</code> action sets a value within a key.
      <code class="literal">-b</code> means it's binary data (REG_BINARY). The binary
      values are specified as hex bytes in the argument list. If the argument
      is <code class="literal">'-'</code>, binary data is read from stdin instead.
      <code class="literal">-d</code> or <code class="literal">-i</code> means the value is a 32
      bit integer value (REG_DWORD). <code class="literal">-D</code> means the value is a
      32 bit integer value in Big Endian representation (REG_DWORD_BIG_ENDIAN).
      <code class="literal">-Q</code> means the value is a 64 bit integer value
      (REG_QWORD). <code class="literal">-s</code> means the value is a string (REG_SZ).
      <code class="literal">-e</code> means it's an expanding string (REG_EXPAND_SZ) that
      contains embedded environment variables. <code class="literal">-m</code> means it's
      a multi-string (REG_MULTI_SZ). If you don't specify one of these,
      <span class="command"><strong>regtool</strong></span> tries to guess the type based on the value you
      give. If it looks like a number, it's a DWORD, unless it's value doesn't
      fit into 32 bit, in which case it's a QWORD. If it starts with a percent,
      it's an expanding string. If you give multiple values, it's a
      multi-string. Else, it's a regular string.</p><p>The <code class="literal">unset</code> action removes a value from a
      key.</p><p>The <code class="literal">load</code> action adds a new subkey and loads the
      contents of a registry hive into it. The parent key must be
      HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE or HKEY_USERS. The <code class="literal">unload</code> action
      unloads the file and removes the subkey. </p><p>The <code class="literal">save</code> action saves a subkey into a registry
      file.  Ideally you append the suffix <code class="filename">.reg</code> to the file
      so it gets automatically recognized as registry file by
      <span class="command"><strong>Windows Explorer</strong></span>.</p><p>The <code class="literal">restore</code> action restores a registry subkey
      from a file saved via the aforementioned <code class="literal">save</code> action.
      </p><p> By default, the last "\" or "/" is assumed to be the separator
      between the key and the value. You can use the <code class="literal">-K</code>
      option to provide an alternate key/value separator character. </p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="setfacl"></a>setfacl</h3></div></div></div><pre class="screen">

</pre><p> SSP - The Single Step Profiler </p><p> Original Author: DJ Delorie </p><p> The SSP is a program that uses the Win32 debug API to run a program
      one ASM instruction at a time. It records the location of each
      instruction used, how many times that instruction is used, and all
      function calls. The results are saved in a format that is usable by the
      profiling program <span class="command"><strong>gprof</strong></span>, although
      <span class="command"><strong>gprof</strong></span> will claim the values are seconds, they really
      are instruction counts. More on that later. </p><p> Because the SSP was originally designed to profile the Cygwin DLL,
      it does not automatically select a block of code to report statistics on.
      You must specify the range of memory addresses to keep track of manually,
      but it's not hard to figure out what to specify. Use the "objdump"
      program to determine the bounds of the target's ".text" section. Let's
      say we're profiling cygwin1.dll. Make sure you've built it with debug
      symbols (else <span class="command"><strong>gprof</strong></span> won't run) and run objdump like
      this: </p><pre class="screen">
$ objdump -h cygwin1.dll
</pre><p> It will print a report
      like this:
      </p><pre class="screen">

      In this case, the VMA is 0x61001000 and the ending address is either
      0x61080000 (start of .data method) or 0x0x6107fa00 (VMA+Size method). </p><p> There are two basic ways to use SSP - either profiling a whole
      program, or selectively profiling parts of the program. </p><p> To profile a whole program, just run <span class="command"><strong>ssp</strong></span> without
      options. By default, it will step the whole program. Here's a simple
      example, using the numbers above:
      </p><pre class="screen">
$ ssp 0x61001000 0x61080000 hello.exe
</pre><p> This will step
      the whole program. It will take at least 8 minutes on a PII/300 (yes,
      really). When it's done, it will create a file called "gmon.out". You can
      turn this data file into a readable report with <span class="command"><strong>gprof</strong></span>:

      The <span class="command"><strong>gprof</strong></span> documentation explains a lot about this
      report, but <span class="command"><strong>ssp</strong></span> changes a few things. For example, the
      first part of the report reports the amount of time spent in each
      function, like this:
      </p><pre class="screen">
Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.
  %   cumulative   self              self     total
 time   seconds   seconds    calls  ms/call  ms/call  name
 10.02    231.22    72.43       46  1574.57  1574.57  strcspn
  7.95    288.70    57.48      130   442.15   442.15  strncasematch
</pre><p>
      The "seconds" columns are really CPU opcodes, 1/100 second per opcode.
      So, "231.22" above means 23,122 opcodes. The ms/call values are 10x too
      big; 1574.57 means 157.457 opcodes per call. Similar adjustments need to
      be made for the "self" and "children" columns in the second part of the
      report. </p><p> OK, so now we've got a huge report that took a long time to
      generate, and we've identified a spot we want to work on optimizing.
      Let's say it's the time() function. We can use SSP to selectively profile
      this function by using OutputDebugString() to control SSP from within the
      program. Here's a sample program:
      </p><pre class="screen">
	#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
	main()
	{
	  time_t t;
	  OutputDebugString("ssp on");
	  time(&amp;t);
	  OutputDebugString("ssp off");
	}
</pre><p> </p><p> Then, add the <code class="literal">-d</code> option to ssp to default to
      *disabling* profiling. The program will run at full speed until the first
      OutputDebugString, then step until the second. You can then use
      <span class="command"><strong>gprof</strong></span> (as usual) to see the performance profile for
      just that portion of the program's execution. </p><p> There are many options to ssp. Since step-profiling makes your
      program run about 1,000 times slower than normal, it's best to understand
      all the options so that you can narrow down the parts of your program you
      need to single-step. </p><p> <code class="literal">-v</code> - verbose. This prints messages about threads
      starting and stopping, OutputDebugString calls, DLLs loading, etc. </p><p> <code class="literal">-t</code> and <code class="literal">-c</code> - tracing. With
      <code class="literal">-t</code>, *every* step's address is written to the file
      "trace.ssp". This can be used to help debug functions, since it can trace
      multiple threads. Clever use of scripts can match addresses with
      disassembled opcodes if needed. Warning: creates *huge* files, very
      quickly. <code class="literal">-c</code> prints each address to the console, useful
      for debugging key chunks of assembler. Use <code class="literal">addr2line -C -f -s -e
      foo.exe &lt; trace.ssp &gt; lines.ssp</code> and then <code class="literal">perl
      cvttrace</code> to convert to symbolic traces. </p><p> <code class="literal">-s</code> - subthreads. Usually, you only need to trace
      the main thread, but sometimes you need to trace all threads, so this
      enables that. It's also needed when you want to profile a function that
      only a subthread calls. However, using OutputDebugString automatically
      enables profiling on the thread that called it, not the main thread. </p><p> <code class="literal">-l</code> - dll profiling. Generates a pretty table of
      how much time was spent in each dll the program used. No sense optimizing
      a function in your program if most of the time is spent in the DLL. I
      usually use the <code class="literal">-v</code>, <code class="literal">-s</code>, and
      <code class="literal">-l</code> options:
      </p><pre class="screen">
$ ssp <code class="literal">-v</code> <code class="literal">-s</code> <code class="literal">-l</code> <code class="literal">-d</code> 0x61001000 0x61080000 hello.exe
