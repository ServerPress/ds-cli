The programme (two programmes really - but they're just links to each
other) converts 48x48x1 images to and from a compressed format.  The
uncompressed images are expected to contain 48x48/4 (576) hex digits.
All other characters and any `0's followed by `X' or `x' are ignored.
Usually the files are 48 lines of "0x%04X,0x%04X,0x%04X,".  The
compressed images contain some number of printable characters.  Non
printable characters, including ` ' are ignored.  The purpose of the
programme is to allow the inclusion of face images within mail headers
using the field name `X-face: '.

The programmes make use of a library which can be used to allow the
compression and decompression algorithms to be used in other
programmes such as mail despatchers and mail notification daemons.

A small amount of editing in the Makefile may be required to get it
going - mainly setting EXECUTABLE to what you want and putting the
manual entry in the right place.

I have merged the -X patch by Piete Brooks <Piete.Brooks@cl.cam.ac.uk>
into the sources and amended the man page. I have given this the
version number 1.1 so that it can be submitted to freshmeat.net and
metalabs.unc.edu.
