<H2>Filename substitution</H2>
If a word contains any of the characters `*', `?', `[' or `{' or begins with
the character `~' it is a candidate for filename substitution, also known as
``globbing''.  This word is then regarded as a pattern (``glob-pattern''), and
replaced with an alphabetically sorted list of file names which match the
pattern.
<P>
In matching filenames, the character `.' at the beginning of a filename or
immediately following a `/', as well as the character `/' must be matched
explicitly (unless either
<B>globdot</B>
or
<B>globstar</B>
or both are set(+)).  The character `*' matches any string of characters, 
including the null string.  The character `?' matches any single character.  
The sequence `[...]' matches any one of the characters enclosed.  
Within `[...]', a pair of
characters separated by `-' matches any character lexically between the two.
<P>
(+) Some glob-patterns can be negated:
The sequence `[^...]' matches any single character <I>not</I> specified by the
characters and/or ranges of characters in the braces.
<P>
An entire glob-pattern can also be negated with `^':
<P>
<menu>
&gt; echo *
<BR>
bang crash crunch ouch
<BR>
&gt; echo ^cr*
<BR>
bang ouch
</menu>
<P>
Glob-patterns which do not use `?', `*', or `[]' or which use `{}' or `~'
(below) are not negated correctly.
<P>
The metanotation `a{b,c,d}e' is a shorthand for `abe ace ade'.
Left-to-right order is preserved: `/usr/source/s1/{oldls,ls}.c' expands
to `/usr/source/s1/oldls.c /usr/source/s1/ls.c'.  The results of matches are
sorted separately at a low level to preserve this order:
`../{memo,*box}' might expand to `../memo ../box ../mbox'.
(Note that `memo' was not sorted with the results of matching `*box'.)
It is not an error when this construct expands to files which do not exist,
but it is possible to get an error from a command to which the expanded list
is passed.
This construct may be nested.
As a special case the words `{', `}' and `{}' are passed undisturbed.
<P>
The character `~' at the beginning of a filename refers to home directories.
Standing alone, i.e., `~', it expands to the invoker's home directory as
reflected in the value of the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#home">home</A></B> shell variable.  When followed by a
name consisting of letters, digits and `-' characters the shell searches for a
user with that name and substitutes their home directory; thus `~ken' might
expand to `/usr/ken' and `~ken/chmach' to `/usr/ken/chmach'.  If the character
`~' is followed by a character other than a letter or `/' or appears elsewhere
than at the beginning of a word, it is left undisturbed.
A command like `setenv MANPATH /usr/man:/usr/local/man:~/lib/man' does not,
therefore, do home directory substitution as one might hope.
<P>
It is an error for a glob-pattern containing `*', `?', `[' or `~', with or
without `^', not to match any files.  However, only one pattern in a list of
glob-patterns must match a file (so that, e.g., `rm *.a *.c *.o' would fail
only if there were no files in the current directory ending in `.a', `.c', or
`.o'), and if the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#nonomatch">nonomatch</A></B> shell variable is set a pattern (or list
of patterns) which matches nothing is left unchanged rather than causing
an error.
<P>
The <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#globstar">globstar</A></B> shell variable can be set to allow `**' or `***' as 
a file glob pattern that matches any string of characters including `/',
recursively traversing any existing sub-directories.  For example, 
`ls **.c' will list all the .c files in the current directory tree.
If used by itself, it will match zero or more sub-directories
(e.g. `ls /usr/include/**/time.h' will list any file named `time.h'
in the /usr/include directory tree; `ls /usr/include/**time.h' will match 
any file in the /usr/include directory tree ending in `time.h'; and
`ls /usr/include/**time**.h' will match any .h file with `time' either
in a subdirectory name or in the filename itself).
To prevent problems with recursion, the `**' glob-pattern will not 
descend into a symbolic link containing a directory.  To override this,
use `***' (+)
<P>
The <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#noglob">noglob</A></B> shell variable can be set to prevent filename substitution,
and the <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#expand-glob">expand-glob</A></I> editor command, normally bound to `^X-*', can be
used to interactively expand individual filename substitutions.
