<H2>Simple commands, pipelines and sequences</H2>
A simple command is a sequence of words, the first of which specifies the
command to be executed.  A series of simple commands joined by `|' characters
forms a pipeline.  The output of each command in a pipeline is connected to the
input of the next.
<P>
Simple commands and pipelines may be joined into sequences with `;', and will
be executed sequentially.  Commands and pipelines can also be joined into
sequences with `||' or `&amp;&amp;', indicating, as in the C language, that the second
is to be executed only if the first fails or succeeds respectively.
<P>
A simple command, pipeline or sequence may be placed in parentheses, `()',
to form a simple command, which may in turn be a component of a pipeline or
sequence.  A command, pipeline or sequence can be executed
without waiting for it to terminate by following it with an `&amp;'.
