We first describe <B><A HREF="The_command-line_editor.html">The command-line editor</A></B>.
The <B><A HREF="Completion_and_listing.html">Completion and listing</A></B> and <B><A HREF="Spelling_correction.html">Spelling correction</A></B> sections
describe two sets of functionality that are implemented as editor commands
but which deserve their own treatment.
Finally, <B><A HREF="Editor_commands.html">Editor commands</A></B> lists and describes
the editor commands specific to the shell and their default bindings.
