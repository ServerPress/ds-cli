<H2>Spelling correction (+)</H2>
The shell can sometimes correct the spelling of filenames, commands and variable names
as well as completing and listing them.
<P>
Individual words can be spelling-corrected with the <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#spell-word">spell-word</A></I>
editor command (usually bound to M-s and M-S)
and the entire input buffer with <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#spell-line">spell-line</A></I> (usually bound to M-$).
The <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#correct">correct</A></B> shell variable can be set to `cmd' to correct the
command name or `all' to correct the entire line each time return is typed,
and <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#autocorrect">autocorrect</A></B> can be set to correct the word to be completed
before each completion attempt.
<P>
When spelling correction is invoked in any of these ways and
the shell thinks that any part of the command line is misspelled,
it prompts with the corrected line:
<P>
<menu>
&gt; set correct = cmd
<BR>
&gt; lz /usr/bin
<BR>
CORRECT&gt;ls /usr/bin (y|n|e|a)?
</menu>
<P>
One can answer `y' or space to execute the corrected line,
`e' to leave the uncorrected command in the input buffer,
`a' to abort the command as if `^C' had been hit, and
anything else to execute the original line unchanged.
<P>
Spelling correction recognizes user-defined completions (see the
<I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#complete">complete</A></I> builtin command).  If an input word in a position for
which a completion is defined resembles a word in the completion list,
spelling correction registers a misspelling and suggests the latter
word as a correction.  However, if the input word does not match any of
the possible completions for that position, spelling correction does
not register a misspelling.
<P>
Like completion, spelling correction works anywhere in the line,
pushing the rest of the line to the right and possibly leaving
extra characters to the right of the cursor.
