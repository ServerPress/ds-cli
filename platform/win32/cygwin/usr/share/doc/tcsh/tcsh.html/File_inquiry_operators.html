</DL>
<P>

<I>file</I> is command and filename expanded and then tested to
see if it has the specified relationship to the real user.  If <I>file</I>
does not exist or is inaccessible or, for the operators indicated by `*',
if the specified file type does not exist on the current system,
then all inquiries return false, i.e., `0'.
<P>
These operators may be combined for conciseness: `-<I>xy file</I>' is
equivalent to `-<I>x file</I> &amp;&amp; -<I>y file</I>'.  (+) For example, `-fx' is true
(returns `1') for plain executable files, but not for directories.
<P>
<B>L</B> may be used in a multiple-operator test to apply subsequent operators
to a symbolic link rather than to the file to which the link points.
For example, `-lLo' is true for links owned by the invoking user.
<B>Lr</B>, <B>Lw</B> and <B>Lx</B> are always true for links and false for
non-links.  <B>L</B> has a different meaning when it is the last operator
in a multiple-operator test; see below.
<P>
It is possible but not useful, and sometimes misleading, to combine operators
which expect <I>file</I> to be a file with operators which do not
(e.g., <B>X</B> and <B>t</B>).  Following <B>L</B> with a non-file operator
can lead to particularly strange results.
<P>
Other operators return other information, i.e., not just `0' or `1'.  (+)
They have the same format as before; <I>op</I> may be one of

Only one of these operators may appear in a multiple-operator test, and it
must be the last.  Note that <B>L</B> has a different meaning at the end of and
elsewhere in a multiple-operator test.  Because `0' is a valid return value
for many of these operators, they do not return `0' when they fail: most
return `-1', and <B>F</B> returns `:'.
<P>
If the shell is compiled with POSIX defined (see the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#version">version</A></B> shell
variable), the result of a file inquiry is based on the permission bits of
the file and not on the result of the <I>access</I>(2) system call.
For example, if one tests a file with <B>-w</B> whose permissions would
ordinarily allow writing but which is on a file system mounted read-only,
the test will succeed in a POSIX shell but fail in a non-POSIX shell.
<P>
File inquiry operators can also be evaluated with the <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#filetest">filetest</A></I> builtin
command (q.v.) (+).
