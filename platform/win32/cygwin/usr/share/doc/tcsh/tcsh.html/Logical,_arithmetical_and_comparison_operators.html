<H2>Logical, arithmetical and comparison operators</H2>
These operators are similar to those of C and have the same precedence.
They include

||  &amp;&amp;  |  ^  &amp;  ==  !=  =~  !~  &lt;=  &gt;=
<BR>
&lt;  &gt; &lt;&lt;  &gt;&gt;  +  -  *  /  %  !  ~  (  )
</menu>
<P>
Here the precedence increases to the right, `==' `!=' `=~' and `!~', `&lt;='
`&gt;=' `&lt;' and `&gt;', `&lt;&lt;' and `&gt;&gt;', `+' and `-', `*' `/' and `%' being, in
groups, at the same level.  The `==' `!=' `=~' and `!~' operators compare
their arguments as strings; all others operate on numbers.  The operators
`=~' and `!~' are like `!=' and `==' except that the right hand side is a
glob-pattern (see <B><A HREF="Filename_substitution.html">Filename substitution</A></B>) against which the left hand
operand is matched.  This reduces the need for use of the <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#switch">switch</A></I>
builtin command in shell scripts when all that is really needed is
pattern matching.
<P>
Null or
missing arguments are considered `0'.  The results of all expressions are
strings, which represent decimal numbers.  It is important to note that
no two components of an expression can appear in the same word; except
when adjacent to components of expressions which are syntactically
significant to the parser (`&amp;' `|' `&lt;' `&gt;' `(' `)') they should be
surrounded by spaces.
