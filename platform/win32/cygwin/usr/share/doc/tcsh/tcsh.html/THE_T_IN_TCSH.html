<H2>THE T IN TCSH</H2>
In 1964, DEC produced the PDP-6.  The PDP-10 was a later re-implementation.  It
was re-christened the DECsystem-10 in 1970 or so when DEC brought out the
second model, the KI10.
<P>
TENEX was created at Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman (a Cambridge, Massachusetts
think tank) in
1972 as an experiment in demand-paged virtual memory operating systems.  They
built a new pager for the DEC PDP-10 and created the OS to go with it.  It was
extremely successful in academia.
<P>
In 1975, DEC brought out a new model of the PDP-10, the KL10; they intended to
have only a version of TENEX, which they had licensed from BBN, for the new
box.  They called their version TOPS-20 (their capitalization is trademarked).
A lot of TOPS-10 users (`The OPerating System for PDP-10') objected; thus DEC
found themselves supporting two incompatible systems on the same hardware--but
then there were 6 on the PDP-11!
<P>
TENEX, and TOPS-20 to version 3, had command completion
via a user-code-level subroutine library called ULTCMD.  With version 3, DEC
moved all that capability and more into the monitor (`kernel' for you Unix
types), accessed by the COMND% JSYS (`Jump to SYStem' instruction, the
supervisor call mechanism [are my IBM roots also showing?]).
<P>
The creator of tcsh was impressed by this feature and several others of TENEX
and TOPS-20, and created a version of csh which mimicked them.
