<H2>Command, filename and directory stack substitution</H2>
The remaining substitutions are applied selectively to the arguments of builtin
commands.  This means that portions of expressions which are not evaluated are
not subjected to these expansions.  For commands which are not internal to the
shell, the command name is substituted separately from the argument list.  This
occurs very late, after input-output redirection is performed, and in a child
of the main shell.
