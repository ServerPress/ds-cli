<H2>Variable substitution</H2>
The shell maintains a list of variables, each of which has as value a list of
zero or more words.
The values of shell variables can be displayed and changed with the
<I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#set">set</A></I> and <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#unset">unset</A></I> commands.
The system maintains its own list of ``environment'' variables.
These can be displayed and changed with <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#printenv">printenv</A></I>, <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#setenv">setenv</A></I> and
<I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#unsetenv">unsetenv</A></I>.
<P>
(+) Variables may be made read-only with `set -r' (q.v.).
Read-only variables may not be modified or unset;
attempting to do so will cause an error.
Once made read-only, a variable cannot be made writable,
so `set -r' should be used with caution.
Environment variables cannot be made read-only.
<P>
Some variables are set by the shell or referred to by it.
For instance, the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#argv">argv</A></B> variable is an image of the shell's argument
list, and words of this variable's value are referred to in special ways.
Some of the variables referred to by the shell are toggles;
the shell does not care what their value is, only whether they are set or not.
For instance, the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#verbose">verbose</A></B> variable is a toggle which causes command
input to be echoed.  The <B>-v</B> command line option sets this variable.
<B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html">Special shell variables</A></B> lists all variables which are referred to by the shell.
<P>
Other operations treat variables numerically.  The `@' command permits numeric
calculations to be performed and the result assigned to a variable.  Variable
values are, however, always represented as (zero or more) strings.  For the
purposes of numeric operations, the null string is considered to be zero, and
the second and subsequent words of multi-word values are ignored.
<P>
After the input line is aliased and parsed, and before each command is
executed, variable substitution is performed keyed by `$' characters.  This
expansion can be prevented by preceding the `$' with a `\' except within `"'s
where it <I>always</I> occurs, and within `''s where it <I>never</I> occurs.
Strings quoted by `\`' are interpreted later (see <B><A HREF="Command_substitution.html">Command substitution</A></B>
below) so `$' substitution does not occur there until later,
if at all.  A `$' is passed unchanged if followed by a blank, tab, or
end-of-line.
<P>
Input/output redirections are recognized before variable expansion, and are
variable expanded separately.  Otherwise, the command name and entire argument
list are expanded together.  It is thus possible for the first (command) word
(to this point) to generate more than one word, the first of which becomes the
command name, and the rest of which become arguments.
<P>
Unless enclosed in `"' or given the `:q' modifier the results of variable
substitution may eventually be command and filename substituted.  Within `"', a
variable whose value consists of multiple words expands to a (portion of a)
single word, with the words of the variable's value separated by blanks.  When
the `:q' modifier is applied to a substitution the variable will expand to
multiple words with each word separated by a blank and quoted to prevent later
command or filename substitution.
<P>
The following metasequences are provided for introducing variable values into
the shell input.  Except as noted, it is an error to reference a variable which
is not set.
<P>
$<I>name</I>
<P>
<DL compact>
<DT>
${<I>name</I>}
<DD>
Substitutes the words of the value of variable <I>name</I>, each separated
by a blank.  Braces insulate <I>name</I> from following characters which would
otherwise be part of it.  Shell variables have names consisting of
letters and digits starting with a letter.  The underscore character is
considered a letter.  If <I>name</I> is not a shell variable, but is set in the
environment, then that value is returned (but some of the other forms
given below are not available in this case).
</DL>
<P>
$<I>name</I>[<I>selector</I>]
<P>
<DL compact>
<DT>
${<I>name</I>[<I>selector</I>]}
<DD>
Substitutes only the selected words from the value of <I>name</I>.
The <I>selector</I> is subjected to `$' substitution and may consist of
a single number or two numbers separated by a `-'.
The first word of a variable's value is numbered `1'.
If the first number of a range is omitted it defaults to `1'.
If the last member of a range is omitted it defaults to `$#<I>name</I>'.
The <I>selector</I> `*' selects all words.
It is not an error for a range to be empty if the
second argument is omitted or in range.
<P>
<DT>
$0
<DD>
Substitutes the name of the file from which command input
is being read.  An error occurs if the name is not known.
</DL>
<P>
$<I>number</I>
<P>
<DL compact>
<DT>
${<I>number</I>}
<DD>
Equivalent to `$argv[<I>number</I>]'.
<P>
<DT>
$*
<DD>
Equivalent to `$argv', which is equivalent to `$argv[*]'.
</DL>
<P>
The `:' modifiers described under <B><A HREF="History_substitution.html">History substitution</A></B>, except for `:p',
can be applied to the substitutions above.  More than one may be used.  (+)
Braces may be needed to insulate a variable substitution from a literal colon
just as with <B><A HREF="History_substitution.html">History substitution</A></B> (q.v.); any modifiers must appear
within the braces.
<P>
The following substitutions can not be modified with `:' modifiers.
<P>
$?<I>name</I>
<P>
<DL compact>
<DT>
${?<I>name</I>}
<DD>
Substitutes the string `1' if <I>name</I> is set, `0' if it is not.
<P>
<DT>
$?0
<DD>
Substitutes `1' if the current input filename is known, `0' if it is not.
Always `0' in interactive shells.
</DL>
<P>
$#<I>name</I>
<P>
<DL compact>
<DT>
${#<I>name</I>}
<DD>
Substitutes the number of words in <I>name</I>.
<P>
<DT>
$#
<DD>
Equivalent to `$#argv'.  (+)
</DL>
<P>
$%<I>name</I>
<P>
<DL compact>
<DT>
${%<I>name</I>}
<DD>
Substitutes the number of characters in <I>name</I>.  (+)
</DL>
<P>
$%<I>number</I>
<P>
<DL compact>
<DT>
${%<I>number</I>}
<DD>
Substitutes the number of characters in $argv[<I>number</I>].  (+)
<P>
<DT>
$?
<DD>
Equivalent to `$status'.  (+)
<P>
<DT>
$$
<DD>
Substitutes the (decimal) process number of the (parent) shell.
<P>
<DT>
$!
<DD>
Substitutes the (decimal) process number of the last
background process started by this shell.  (+)
<P>
<DT>
$_
<DD>
Substitutes the command line of the last command executed.  (+)
<P>
<DT>
$&lt;
<DD>
Substitutes a line from the standard input, with no further interpretation
thereafter.  It can be used to read from the keyboard in a shell script.
(+) While <I>csh</I> always quotes $&lt;, as if it were equivalent to `$&lt;:q',
<I>tcsh</I> does not.  Furthermore, when <I>tcsh</I> is waiting for a line to be
typed the user may type an interrupt to interrupt the sequence into
which the line is to be substituted, but <I>csh</I> does not allow this.
</DL>
<P>
The editor command <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#expand-variables">expand-variables</A></I>, normally bound to `^X-$',
can be used to interactively expand individual variables.
