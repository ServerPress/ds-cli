<H2>BUGS</H2>
When a suspended command is restarted, the shell prints the directory
it started in if this is different from the current directory.  This can
be misleading (i.e., wrong) as the job may have changed directories internally.
<P>
Shell builtin functions are not stoppable/restartable.  Command sequences
of the form `a ; b ; c' are also not handled gracefully when stopping is
attempted.  If you suspend `b', the shell will then immediately execute
`c'.  This is especially noticeable if this expansion results from an
<I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#alias">alias</A></I>.  It suffices to place the sequence of commands in ()'s to force it
to a subshell, i.e., `( a ; b ; c )'.
<P>
Control over tty output after processes are started is primitive; perhaps
this will inspire someone to work on a good virtual terminal interface.
In a virtual terminal interface much more interesting things could be
done with output control.
<P>
Alias substitution is most often used to clumsily simulate shell procedures;
shell procedures should be provided rather than aliases.
<P>
Control structures should be parsed rather than being recognized as
built-in commands.  This would allow control commands to be placed anywhere,
to be combined with `|', and to be used with `&amp;' and `;' metasyntax.
<P>
<I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#foreach">foreach</A></I> doesn't ignore here documents when looking for its <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#end">end</A></I>.
<P>
It should be possible to use the `:' modifiers on the output of command
substitutions.
<P>
The screen update for lines longer than the screen width is very poor
if the terminal cannot move the cursor up (i.e., terminal type `dumb').
<P>
<B><A HREF="ENVIRONMENT.html#HPATH">HPATH</A></B> and <B><A HREF="ENVIRONMENT.html#NOREBIND">NOREBIND</A></B> don't need to be environment variables.
<P>
Glob-patterns which do not use `?', `*' or `[]' or which use `{}' or `~'
are not negated correctly.
<P>
The single-command form of <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#if">if</A></I> does output redirection even if
the expression is false and the command is not executed.
<P>
<I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#ls-F">ls-F</A></I> includes file identification characters when sorting filenames
and does not handle control characters in filenames well.  It cannot be
interrupted.
<P>
Command substitution supports multiple commands and conditions, but not
cycles or backward <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#goto">goto</A></I>s.
<P>
Report bugs at http://bugs.gw.com/, preferably with fixes.  If you want to
help maintain and test tcsh, send mail to tcsh-request@mx.gw.com with the
text `subscribe tcsh' on a line by itself in the body.
