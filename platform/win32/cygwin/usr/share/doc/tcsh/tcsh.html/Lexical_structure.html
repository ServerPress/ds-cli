<H2>Lexical structure</H2>
The shell splits input lines into words at blanks and tabs.  The special
characters `&amp;', `|', `;', `&lt;', `&gt;', `(', and `)' and the doubled characters
`&amp;&amp;', `||', `&lt;&lt;' and `&gt;&gt;' are always separate words, whether or not they are
surrounded by whitespace.
<P>
When the shell's input is not a terminal, the character `#' is taken to begin a
comment.  Each `#' and the rest of the input line on which it appears is
discarded before further parsing.
<P>
A special character (including a blank or tab) may be prevented from having
its special meaning, and possibly made part of another word, by preceding it
with a backslash (`\') or enclosing it in single (`''), double (`"') or
backward (`\`') quotes.  When not otherwise quoted a newline preceded by a `\'
is equivalent to a blank, but inside quotes this sequence results in a
newline.
<P>
Furthermore, all <B><A HREF="Substitutions.html">Substitutions</A></B> (see below) except <B><A HREF="History_substitution.html">History substitution</A></B>
can be prevented by enclosing the strings (or parts of strings)
in which they appear with single quotes or by quoting the crucial character(s)
(e.g., `$' or `\`' for <B><A HREF="Variable_substitution.html">Variable substitution</A></B> or <B><A HREF="Command_substitution.html">Command substitution</A></B> respectively)
with `\'.  (<B><A HREF="Alias_substitution.html">Alias substitution</A></B> is no exception: quoting in any way any
character of a word for which an <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#alias">alias</A></I> has been defined prevents
substitution of the alias.  The usual way of quoting an alias is to precede it
with a backslash.) <B><A HREF="History_substitution.html">History substitution</A></B> is prevented by
backslashes but not by single quotes.  Strings quoted with double or backward
quotes undergo <B><A HREF="Variable_substitution.html">Variable substitution</A></B> and <B><A HREF="Command_substitution.html">Command substitution</A></B>, but other
substitutions are prevented.
<P>
Text inside single or double quotes becomes a single word (or part of one).
Metacharacters in these strings, including blanks and tabs, do not form
separate words.  Only in one special case (see <B><A HREF="Command_substitution.html">Command substitution</A></B>
below) can a double-quoted string yield parts of more than one word;
single-quoted strings never do.  Backward quotes are special: they signal
<B><A HREF="Command_substitution.html">Command substitution</A></B> (q.v.), which may result in more than one word.
<P>
Quoting complex strings, particularly strings which themselves contain quoting
characters, can be confusing.  Remember that quotes need not be used as they are
in human writing!  It may be easier to quote not an entire string, but only
those parts of the string which need quoting, using different types of quoting
to do so if appropriate.
<P>
The <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#backslash_quote">backslash_quote</A></B> shell variable (q.v.) can be set to make backslashes
always quote `\', `'', and `"'.  (+) This may make complex quoting tasks
easier, but it can cause syntax errors in <I>csh</I>(1) scripts.
