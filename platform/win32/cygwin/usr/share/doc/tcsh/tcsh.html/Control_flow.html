<H2>Control flow</H2>
The shell contains a number of commands which can be used to regulate the
flow of control in command files (shell scripts) and (in limited but
useful ways) from terminal input.  These commands all operate by forcing the
shell to reread or skip in its input and, due to the implementation,
restrict the placement of some of the commands.
<P>
The <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#foreach">foreach</A></I>, <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#switch">switch</A></I>, and <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#while">while</A></I> statements, as well as the
<I>if-then-else</I> form of the <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#if">if</A></I> statement, require that the major
keywords appear in a single simple command on an input line as shown below.
<P>
If the shell's input is not seekable, the shell buffers up input whenever
a loop is being read and performs seeks in this internal buffer to
accomplish the rereading implied by the loop.  (To the extent that this
allows, backward <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#goto">goto</A></I>s will succeed on non-seekable inputs.)
