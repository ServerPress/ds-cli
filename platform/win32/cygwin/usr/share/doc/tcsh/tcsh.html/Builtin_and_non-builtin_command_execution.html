<H2>Builtin and non-builtin command execution</H2>
Builtin commands are executed within the shell.  If any component of a
pipeline except the last is a builtin command, the pipeline is executed
in a subshell.
<P>
Parenthesized commands are always executed in a subshell.
<P>
<menu>
(cd; pwd); pwd
</menu>
<P>
thus prints the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#home">home</A></B> directory, leaving you where you were
(printing this after the home directory), while
<P>
<menu>
cd; pwd
</menu>
<P>
leaves you in the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#home">home</A></B> directory.  Parenthesized commands are most often
used to prevent <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#cd">cd</A></I> from affecting the current shell.
<P>
When a command to be executed is found not to be a builtin command the shell
attempts to execute the command via <I>execve</I>(2).  Each word in the variable
<B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#path">path</A></B> names a directory in which the shell will look for the
command.  If the shell is not given a <B>-f</B> option, the shell
hashes the names in these directories into an internal table so that it will
try an <I>execve</I>(2) in only a directory where there is a possibility that the
command resides there.  This greatly speeds command location when a large
number of directories are present in the search path. This hashing mechanism is
not used:
<P>
<DL compact>
<DT>
<B>1.</B>
<DD>
If hashing is turned explicitly off via <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#unhash">unhash</A></I>.
<P>
<DT>
<B>2.</B>
<DD>
If the shell was given a <B>-f</B> argument.
<P>
<DT>
<B>3.</B>
<DD>
For each directory component of <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#path">path</A></B> which does not begin with a `/'.
<P>
<DT>
<B>4.</B>
<DD>
If the command contains a `/'.
</DL>
<P>
In the above four cases the shell concatenates each component of the path
vector with the given command name to form a path name of a file which it
then attempts to execute it. If execution is successful, the search stops.
<P>
If the file has execute permissions but is not an executable to the system
(i.e., it is neither an executable binary nor a script that specifies its
interpreter), then it is assumed to be a file containing shell commands and
a new shell is spawned to read it.  The <I><A HREF="Special_aliases.html#shell">shell</A></I> special alias may be set
to specify an interpreter other than the shell itself.
<P>
On systems which do not understand the `#!' script interpreter convention
the shell may be compiled to emulate it; see the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#version">version</A></B> shell
variable.  If so, the shell checks the first line of the file to
see if it is of the form `#!<I>interpreter</I> <I>arg</I> ...'.  If it is,
the shell starts <I>interpreter</I> with the given <I>arg</I>s and feeds the
file to it on standard input.
