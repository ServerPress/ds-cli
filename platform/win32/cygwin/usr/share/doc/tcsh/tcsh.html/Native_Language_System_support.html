<H2>Native Language System support (+)</H2>
The shell is eight bit clean
(if so compiled; see the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#version">version</A></B> shell variable)
and thus supports character sets needing this capability.
NLS support differs depending on whether or not
the shell was compiled to use the system's NLS (again, see <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#version">version</A></B>).
In either case, 7-bit ASCII is the default character code
(e.g., the classification of which characters are printable) and sorting,
and changing the <B><A HREF="ENVIRONMENT.html#LANG">LANG</A></B> or <B><A HREF="ENVIRONMENT.html#LC_CTYPE">LC_CTYPE</A></B> environment variables
causes a check for possible changes in these respects.
<P>
When using the system's NLS, the <I>setlocale</I>(3) function is called
to determine appropriate character code/classification and sorting
(e.g., a 'en_CA.UTF-8' would yield "UTF-8" as a character code).
This function typically examines the <B><A HREF="ENVIRONMENT.html#LANG">LANG</A></B> and <B><A HREF="ENVIRONMENT.html#LC_CTYPE">LC_CTYPE</A></B>
environment variables; refer to the system documentation for further details.
When not using the system's NLS, the shell simulates it by assuming that the
ISO 8859-1 character set is used
whenever either of the <B><A HREF="ENVIRONMENT.html#LANG">LANG</A></B> and <B><A HREF="ENVIRONMENT.html#LC_CTYPE">LC_CTYPE</A></B> variables are set, regardless of
their values.  Sorting is not affected for the simulated NLS.
<P>
In addition, with both real and simulated NLS, all printable
characters in the range \200-\377, i.e., those that have
M-<I>char</I> bindings, are automatically rebound to <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#self-insert-command">self-insert-command</A></I>.
The corresponding binding for the escape-<I>char</I> sequence, if any, is
left alone.
These characters are not rebound if the <B><A HREF="ENVIRONMENT.html#NOREBIND">NOREBIND</A></B> environment variable
is set.  This may be useful for the simulated NLS or a primitive real NLS
which assumes full ISO 8859-1.  Otherwise, all M-<I>char</I> bindings in the
range \240-\377 are effectively undone.
Explicitly rebinding the relevant keys with <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#bindkey">bindkey</A></I>
is of course still possible.
<P>
Unknown characters (i.e., those that are neither printable nor control
characters) are printed in the format \nnn.
If the tty is not in 8 bit mode, other 8 bit characters are printed by
converting them to ASCII and using standout mode.  The shell
never changes the 7/8 bit mode of the tty and tracks user-initiated
changes of 7/8 bit mode.  NLS users (or, for that matter, those who want to
use a meta key) may need to explicitly set
the tty in 8 bit mode through the appropriate <I>stty</I>(1)
command in, e.g., the <I><A HREF="FILES.html#~/.login">~/.login</A></I> file.
