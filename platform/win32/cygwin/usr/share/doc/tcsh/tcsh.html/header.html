 Style notes for the tcsh man page:
 
 - Tags in lists are bold, except in the FILES section where they are
   italic.
 
 - References are bold for section headings and environment and shell
   variables and italic for commands (externals, builtins, aliases, and
   editor commands) and arguments to commands.
 
 - Be careful with the .B and .I macros: they handle only a limited number
   of words. Work around this with \fB and \fI, but only if absolutely
   necessary, because tcsh.man2html uses .B/.I to find name anchors.
 
 - Indent in multiples of 4, usually 8.
 
 - Use `', not '' or "", except of course in shell syntax examples.
   '' at the beginning of a line will vanish!

 - Use \` for literal back-quote (`).

 - Use \ for literal backslash (\).
 
 - Use -, not -.
 
 - Include the tilde when naming dot files. `~/.login', not `.login'.
 
 - Refer to external commands in man page format, e.g., `csh(1)'. However,
   tcsh is `tcsh', not `tcsh(1)', because this is the tcsh man page (and
   see the next note anyway).
 
 - Say `the shell', not `tcsh', unless distinguishing between tcsh and csh.
 
 - Say `shell variable'/`environment variable' instead of `variable'
   and `builtin command'/`editor command' instead of `builtin' or `command'
   unless the distinction is absolutely clear from context.
 
 - Use the simple present tense. `The shell uses', not `The shell will use'.
 
 - IMPORTANT: Cross-reference as much as possible. Commands, variables,
   etc. in the reference section should be mentioned in the appropriate
   descriptive section, or at least in the reference-section description
   of another command (or whatever) which is mentioned in a description
   section. Remember to note OS-specific things in "OS variant support",
   new features in NEW FEATURES and referenced external commands in SEE
   ALSO.
 
 - tcsh.man2html depends heavily on the specific nroff commands used in the
   man page when the script was written. Please stick closely to the style
   used here if you can. In particular, please don't use nroff commands
   which aren't already used herein.
