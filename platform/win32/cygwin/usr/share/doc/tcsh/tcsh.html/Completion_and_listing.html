<H2>Completion and listing (+)</H2>
The shell is often able to complete words when given a unique abbreviation.
Type part of a word (for example `ls /usr/lost') and hit the tab key to
run the <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#complete-word">complete-word</A></I> editor command.
The shell completes the filename `/usr/lost' to `/usr/lost+found/',
replacing the incomplete word with the complete word in the input buffer.
(Note the terminal `/'; completion adds a `/' to the
end of completed directories and a space to the end of other completed words,
to speed typing and provide a visual indicator of successful completion.
The <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#addsuffix">addsuffix</A></B> shell variable can be unset to prevent this.)
If no match is found (perhaps `/usr/lost+found' doesn't exist),
the terminal bell rings.
If the word is already complete (perhaps there is a `/usr/lost' on your
system, or perhaps you were thinking too far ahead and typed the whole thing)
a `/' or space is added to the end if it isn't already there.
<P>
Completion works anywhere in the line, not at just the end; completed
text pushes the rest of the line to the right.  Completion in the middle of a word
often results in leftover characters to the right of the cursor that need
to be deleted.
<P>
Commands and variables can be completed in much the same way.
For example, typing `em[tab]' would complete `em' to
`emacs' if <I>emacs</I> were the only command on your system beginning with `em'.
Completion can find a command in any directory in <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#path">path</A></B> or if
given a full pathname.
Typing `echo $ar[tab]' would complete `$ar' to `$argv'
if no other variable began with `ar'.
<P>
The shell parses the input buffer to determine whether the word you want to
complete should be completed as a filename, command or variable.
The first word in the buffer and the first word following
`;', `|', `|&amp;', `&amp;&amp;' or `||' is considered to be a command.
A word beginning with `$' is considered to be a variable.
Anything else is a filename.  An empty line is `completed' as a filename.
<P>
You can list the possible completions of a word at any time by typing `^D'
to run the <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#delete-char-or-list-or-eof">delete-char-or-list-or-eof</A></I> editor command.
The shell lists the possible completions using the <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#ls-F">ls-F</A></I> builtin (q.v.)
and reprints the prompt and unfinished command line, for example:
<P>
<menu>
&gt; ls /usr/l[^D]
<BR>
lbin/       lib/        local/      lost+found/
<BR>
&gt; ls /usr/l
</menu>
<P>
If the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#autolist">autolist</A></B> shell variable is set, the shell lists the remaining
choices (if any) whenever completion fails:
<P>
<menu>
&gt; set autolist
<BR>
&gt; nm /usr/lib/libt[tab]
<BR>
libtermcap.a@ libtermlib.a@
<BR>
&gt; nm /usr/lib/libterm
</menu>
<P>
If <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#autolist">autolist</A></B> is set to `ambiguous', choices are listed only when
completion fails and adds no new characters to the word being completed.
<P>
A filename to be completed can contain variables, your own or others' home
directories abbreviated with `~' (see <B><A HREF="Filename_substitution.html">Filename substitution</A></B>) and
directory stack entries abbreviated with `='
(see <B><A HREF="Directory_stack_substitution.html">Directory stack substitution</A></B>).  For example,
<P>
<menu>
&gt; ls ~k[^D]
<BR>
kahn    kas     kellogg
<BR>
&gt; ls ~ke[tab]
<BR>
&gt; ls ~kellogg/
</menu>
<P>
or
<P>
<menu>
&gt; set local = /usr/local
<BR>
&gt; ls $lo[tab]
<BR>
&gt; ls $local/[^D]
<BR>
bin/ etc/ lib/ man/ src/
<BR>
&gt; ls $local/
</menu>
<P>
Note that variables can also be expanded explicitly with the
<I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#expand-variables">expand-variables</A></I> editor command.
<P>
<I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#delete-char-or-list-or-eof">delete-char-or-list-or-eof</A></I> lists at only the end of the line;
in the middle of a line it deletes the character under the cursor and
on an empty line it logs one out or, if <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#ignoreeof">ignoreeof</A></B> is set, does nothing.
`M-^D', bound to the editor command <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#list-choices">list-choices</A></I>, lists completion
possibilities anywhere on a line, and <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#list-choices">list-choices</A></I> (or any one of the
related editor commands that do or don't delete, list and/or log out,
listed under <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#delete-char-or-list-or-eof">delete-char-or-list-or-eof</A></I>) can be bound to `^D' with
the <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#bindkey">bindkey</A></I> builtin command if so desired.
<P>
The <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#complete-word-fwd">complete-word-fwd</A></I> and <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#complete-word-back">complete-word-back</A></I> editor commands
(not bound to any keys by default) can be used to cycle up and down through
the list of possible completions, replacing the current word with the next or
previous word in the list.
<P>
The shell variable <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#fignore">fignore</A></B> can be set to a list of suffixes to be
ignored by completion.  Consider the following:
<P>
<menu>
&gt; ls
<BR>
Makefile        condiments.h~   main.o          side.c
<BR>
README          main.c          meal            side.o
<BR>
condiments.h    main.c~
<BR>
&gt; set fignore = (.o \~)
<BR>
&gt; emacs ma[^D]
<BR>
main.c   main.c~  main.o
<BR>
&gt; emacs ma[tab]
<BR>
&gt; emacs main.c
</menu>
<P>
`main.c~' and `main.o' are ignored by completion (but not listing),
because they end in suffixes in <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#fignore">fignore</A></B>.
Note that a `\' was needed in front of `~' to prevent it from being
expanded to <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#home">home</A></B> as described under <B><A HREF="Filename_substitution.html">Filename substitution</A></B>.
<B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#fignore">fignore</A></B> is ignored if only one completion is possible.
<P>
If the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#complete">complete</A></B> shell variable is set to `enhance', completion
1) ignores case and 2) considers periods, hyphens and underscores
(`.', `-' and `_') to be word separators and hyphens and underscores to
be equivalent.  If you had the following files
<P>
<menu>
comp.lang.c      comp.lang.perl   comp.std.c++
<BR>
comp.lang.c++    comp.std.c
</menu>
<P>
and typed `mail -f c.l.c[tab]', it would be completed to
`mail -f comp.lang.c', and ^D would list `comp.lang.c' and `comp.lang.c++'.
`mail -f c..c++[^D]' would list `comp.lang.c++' and `comp.std.c++'.  Typing
`rm a--file[^D]' in the following directory
<P>
<menu>
A_silly_file    a-hyphenated-file    another_silly_file
</menu>
<P>
would list all three files, because case is ignored and hyphens and
underscores are equivalent.  Periods, however, are not equivalent to
hyphens or underscores.
<P>
If the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#complete">complete</A></B> shell variable is set to `Enhance', completion
ignores case and differences between a hyphen and an underscore word
separator only when the user types a lowercase character or a hyphen.
Entering an uppercase character or an underscore will not match the 
corresponding lowercase character or hyphen word separator.  
Typing `rm a--file[^D]' in the directory of the previous example would 
still list all three files, but typing `rm A--file' would match only 
`A_silly_file' and typing `rm a__file[^D]' would match just `A_silly_file' 
and `another_silly_file' because the user explicitly used an uppercase 
or an underscore character.  
<P>
Completion and listing are affected by several other shell variables:
<B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#recexact">recexact</A></B> can be set to complete on the shortest possible unique
match, even if more typing might result in a longer match:
<P>
<menu>
&gt; ls
<BR>
fodder   foo      food     foonly
<BR>
&gt; set recexact
<BR>
&gt; rm fo[tab]
</menu>
<P>
just beeps, because `fo' could expand to `fod' or `foo', but if we type
another `o',
<P>
<menu>
&gt; rm foo[tab]
<BR>
&gt; rm foo
</menu>
<P>
the completion completes on `foo', even though `food' and `foonly'
also match.
<B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#autoexpand">autoexpand</A></B> can be set to run the <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#expand-history">expand-history</A></I> editor command
before each completion attempt, <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#autocorrect">autocorrect</A></B> can be set to
spelling-correct the word to be completed (see <B><A HREF="Spelling_correction.html">Spelling correction</A></B>)
before each completion attempt and <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#correct">correct</A></B> can be set to complete
commands automatically after one hits `return'.
<B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#matchbeep">matchbeep</A></B> can be set to make completion beep or not beep in a variety
of situations, and <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#nobeep">nobeep</A></B> can be set to never beep at all.
<B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#nostat">nostat</A></B> can be set to a list of directories and/or patterns that
match directories to prevent the completion mechanism from <I>stat</I>(2)ing
those directories.
<B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#listmax">listmax</A></B> and <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#listmaxrows">listmaxrows</A></B> can be set to limit the number of items
and rows (respectively) that are listed without asking first.
<B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#recognize_only_executables">recognize_only_executables</A></B> can be set to make the shell list only
executables when listing commands, but it is quite slow.
<P>
Finally, the <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#complete">complete</A></I> builtin command can be used to tell the shell how
to complete words other than filenames, commands and variables.
Completion and listing do not work on glob-patterns (see <B><A HREF="Filename_substitution.html">Filename substitution</A></B>),
but the <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#list-glob">list-glob</A></I> and <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#expand-glob">expand-glob</A></I> editor commands perform
equivalent functions for glob-patterns.
