<H2>History substitution</H2>
Each command, or ``event'', input from the terminal is saved in the history
list.  The previous command is always saved, and the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#history">history</A></B> shell
variable can be set to a number to save that many commands.  The <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#histdup">histdup</A></B>
shell variable can be set to not save duplicate events or consecutive duplicate
events.
<P>
Saved commands are numbered sequentially from 1 and stamped with the time.
It is not usually necessary to use event numbers, but the current event number
can be made part of the prompt by placing an `!' in the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#prompt">prompt</A></B> shell variable.
<P>
The shell actually saves history in expanded and literal (unexpanded) forms.
If the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#histlit">histlit</A></B> shell variable is set, commands that display and store
history use the literal form.
<P>
The <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#history">history</A></I> builtin command can print, store in a file, restore
and clear the history list at any time,
and the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#savehist">savehist</A></B> and <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#histfile">histfile</A></B> shell variables can be set to
store the history list automatically on logout and restore it on login.
<P>
History substitutions introduce words from the history list into the input
stream, making it easy to repeat commands, repeat arguments of a previous
command in the current command, or fix spelling mistakes in the previous
command with little typing and a high degree of confidence.
<P>
History substitutions begin with the character `!'.  They may begin anywhere in
the input stream, but they do not nest.  The `!' may be preceded by a `\' to
prevent its special meaning; for convenience, a `!' is passed unchanged when it
is followed by a blank, tab, newline, `=' or `('.  History substitutions also
occur when an input line begins with `^'.  This special abbreviation will be
described later.  The characters used to signal history substitution (`!' and
`^') can be changed by setting the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#histchars">histchars</A></B> shell variable.  Any input
line which contains a history substitution is printed before it is executed.
<P>
A history substitution may have an ``event specification'', which indicates
the event from which words are to be taken, a ``word designator'',
which selects particular words from the chosen event, and/or a ``modifier'',
which manipulates the selected words.
<P>
An event specification can be
<P>
<P>
<menu>
<DL compact>
<DT>
<I>n</I>
<DD>
A number, referring to a particular event
<P>
<DT>
-<I>n</I>
<DD>
An offset, referring to the event <I>n</I> before the current event
<P>
<DT>
#
<DD>
The current event.
This should be used carefully in <I>csh</I>(1), where there is no check for
recursion.  <I>tcsh</I> allows 10 levels of recursion.  (+)
<P>
<DT>
!
<DD>
The previous event (equivalent to `-1')
<P>
<DT>
<I>s</I>
<DD>
The most recent event whose first word begins with the string <I>s</I>
<P>
<DT>
?<I>s</I>?
<DD>
The most recent event which contains the string <I>s</I>.
The second `?' can be omitted if it is immediately followed by a newline.
</DL>
<P>
</menu>
For example, consider this bit of someone's history list:
<P>
<menu>
 9  8:30    nroff -man wumpus.man
<BR>
10  8:31    cp wumpus.man wumpus.man.old
<BR>
11  8:36    vi wumpus.man
<BR>
12  8:37    diff wumpus.man.old wumpus.man
</menu>
<P>
The commands are shown with their event numbers and time stamps.
The current event, which we haven't typed in yet, is event 13.
`!11' and `!-2' refer to event 11.
`!!' refers to the previous event, 12.  `!!' can be abbreviated `!' if it is
followed by `:' (`:' is described below).
`!n' refers to event 9, which begins with `n'.
`!?old?' also refers to event 12, which contains `old'.
Without word designators or modifiers history references simply expand to the
entire event, so we might type `!cp' to redo the copy command or `!!|more'
if the `diff' output scrolled off the top of the screen.
<P>
History references may be insulated from the surrounding text with braces if
necessary.  For example, `!vdoc' would look for a command beginning with
`vdoc', and, in this example, not find one, but `!{v}doc' would expand
unambiguously to `vi wumpus.mandoc'.
Even in braces, history substitutions do not nest.
<P>
(+) While <I>csh</I>(1) expands, for example, `!3d' to event 3 with the
letter `d' appended to it, <I>tcsh</I> expands it to the last event beginning
with `3d'; only completely numeric arguments are treated as event numbers.
This makes it possible to recall events beginning with numbers.
To expand `!3d' as in <I>csh</I>(1) say `!{3}d'.
<P>
To select words from an event we can follow the event specification by a `:'
and a designator for the desired words.  The words of an input line are
numbered from 0, the first (usually command) word being 0, the second word
(first argument) being 1, etc.  The basic word designators are:
<P>
<P>
<menu>
<DL compact>
<DT>
0
<DD>
The first (command) word
<P>
<DT>
<I>n</I>
<DD>
The <I>n</I>th argument
<P>
<DT>
^
<DD>
The first argument, equivalent to `1'
<P>
<DT>
$
<DD>
The last argument
<P>
<DT>
%
<DD>
The word matched by an ?<I>s</I>? search
<P>
<DT>
<I>x-y</I>
<DD>
A range of words
<P>
<DT>
<I>-y</I>
<DD>
Equivalent to <I>`0-y'</I>
<P>
<DT>
*
<DD>
Equivalent to `^-$', but returns nothing if the event contains only 1 word
<P>
<DT>
<I>x*</I>
<DD>
Equivalent to <I>`x-$'</I>
<P>
<DT>
<I>x-</I>
<DD>
Equivalent to <I>`x*'</I>, but omitting the last word (`$')
</DL>
<P>
</menu>
Selected words are inserted into the command line separated by single blanks.
For example, the `diff' command in the previous example might have been
typed as `diff !!:1.old !!:1' (using `:1' to select the first argument
from the previous event) or `diff !-2:2 !-2:1' to select and swap the
arguments from the `cp' command.  If we didn't care about the order of the
`diff' we might have said `diff !-2:1-2' or simply `diff !-2:*'.
The `cp' command might have been written `cp wumpus.man !#:1.old', using `#'
to refer to the current event.
`!n:- hurkle.man' would reuse the first two words from the `nroff' command
to say `nroff -man hurkle.man'.
<P>
The `:' separating the event specification from the word designator can be
omitted if the argument selector begins with a `^', `$', `*', `%' or `-'.
For example, our `diff' command might have been `diff !!^.old !!^' or,
equivalently, `diff !!$.old !!$'.  However, if `!!' is abbreviated `!',
an argument selector beginning with `-' will be interpreted as an event
specification.
<P>
A history reference may have a word designator but no event specification.
It then references the previous command.
Continuing our `diff' example, we could have said simply `diff
!^.old !^' or, to get the arguments in the opposite order, just `diff !*'.
<P>
The word or words in a history reference can be edited, or ``modified'',
by following it with one or more modifiers, each preceded by a `:':
<P>
<P>
<menu>
<DL compact>
<DT>
h
<DD>
Remove a trailing pathname component, leaving the head.
<P>
<DT>
t
<DD>
Remove all leading pathname components, leaving the tail.
<P>
<DT>
r
<DD>
Remove a filename extension `.xxx', leaving the root name.
<P>
<DT>
e
<DD>
Remove all but the extension.
<P>
<DT>
u
<DD>
Uppercase the first lowercase letter.
<P>
<DT>
l
<DD>
Lowercase the first uppercase letter.
<P>
<DT>
s<I>/l/r/</I>
<DD>
Substitute <I>l</I> for <I>r</I>.
<I>l</I> is simply a string like <I>r</I>, not a regular expression as in
the eponymous <I>ed</I>(1) command.
Any character may be used as the delimiter in place of `/';
a `\' can be used to quote the delimiter inside <I>l</I> and <I>r</I>.
The character `&amp;' in the <I>r</I> is replaced by <I>l</I>; `\' also quotes `&amp;'.
If <I>l</I> is empty (``''), the <I>l</I> from a previous substitution or the
<I>s</I> from a previous search or event number in event specification is used.
The trailing delimiter may be omitted if it is immediately followed by a newline.
<P>
<DT>
&amp;
<DD>
Repeat the previous substitution.
<P>
<DT>
g
<DD>
Apply the following modifier once to each word.
<P>
<DT>
a (+)
<DD>
Apply the following modifier as many times as possible to a single word.
`a' and `g' can be used together to apply a modifier globally.
With the `s' modifier, only the patterns contained in the original word are
substituted, not patterns that contain any substitution result.
<P>
<DT>
p
<DD>
Print the new command line but do not execute it.
<P>
<DT>
q
<DD>
Quote the substituted words, preventing further substitutions.
<P>
<DT>
x
<DD>
Like q, but break into words at blanks, tabs and newlines.
</DL>
<P>
</menu>
Modifiers are applied to only the first modifiable word (unless `g' is used).
It is an error for no word to be modifiable.
<P>
For example, the `diff' command might have been written as `diff wumpus.man.old
!#^:r', using `:r' to remove `.old' from the first argument on the same line
(`!#^').  We could say `echo hello out there', then `echo !*:u' to capitalize
`hello', `echo !*:au' to say it out loud, or `echo !*:agu' to really shout.
We might follow `mail -s "I forgot my password" rot' with `!:s/rot/root' to
correct the spelling of `root' (but see <B><A HREF="Spelling_correction.html">Spelling correction</A></B> for a
different approach).
<P>
There is a special abbreviation for substitutions.
`^', when it is the first character on an input line, is equivalent to `!:s^'.
Thus we might have said `^rot^root' to make the spelling correction in the
previous example.
This is the only history substitution which does not explicitly begin with `!'.
<P>
(+) In <I>csh</I> as such, only one modifier may be applied to each history
or variable expansion.  In <I>tcsh</I>, more than one may be used, for example
<P>
<menu>
% mv wumpus.man /usr/man/man1/wumpus.1
<BR>
% man !$:t:r
<BR>
man wumpus
</menu>
<P>
In <I>csh</I>, the result would be `wumpus.1:r'.  A substitution followed by a
colon may need to be insulated from it with braces:
<P>
<menu>
&gt; mv a.out /usr/games/wumpus
<BR>
&gt; setenv PATH !$:h:$PATH
<BR>
Bad ! modifier: $.
<BR>
&gt; setenv PATH !{-2$:h}:$PATH
<BR>
setenv PATH /usr/games:/bin:/usr/bin:.
</menu>
<P>
The first attempt would succeed in <I>csh</I> but fails in <I>tcsh</I>,
because <I>tcsh</I> expects another modifier after the second colon
rather than `$'.
<P>
Finally, history can be accessed through the editor as well as through
the substitutions just described.
The <I>up-</I> and <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#down-history">down-history</A></I>, <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#history-search-backward">history-search-backward</A></I> and
<I>-forward</I>, <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#i-search-back">i-search-back</A></I> and <I>-fwd</I>,
<I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#vi-search-back">vi-search-back</A></I> and <I>-fwd</I>, <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#copy-prev-word">copy-prev-word</A></I>
and <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#insert-last-word">insert-last-word</A></I> editor commands search for
events in the history list and copy them into the input buffer.
The <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#toggle-literal-history">toggle-literal-history</A></I> editor command switches between the
expanded and literal forms of history lines in the input buffer.
<I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#expand-history">expand-history</A></I> and <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#expand-line">expand-line</A></I> expand history substitutions
in the current word and in the entire input buffer respectively.
