<H2>Other substitutions (+)</H2>
There are several more transformations involving filenames, not strictly
related to the above but mentioned here for completeness.
<I>Any</I> filename may be expanded to a full path when the
<B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#symlinks">symlinks</A></B> variable (q.v.) is set to `expand'.
Quoting prevents this expansion, and
the <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#normalize-path">normalize-path</A></I> editor command does it on demand.
The <I><A HREF="Editor_commands.html#normalize-command">normalize-command</A></I> editor command expands commands in PATH into
full paths on demand.
Finally, <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#cd">cd</A></I> and <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#pushd">pushd</A></I> interpret `-' as the old working directory
(equivalent to the shell variable <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#owd">owd</A></B>).
This is not a substitution at all, but an abbreviation recognized by only
those commands.  Nonetheless, it too can be prevented by quoting.
