<H2>Status reporting</H2>
The shell learns immediately whenever a process changes state.  It normally
informs you whenever a job becomes blocked so that no further progress is
possible, but only right before it prints a prompt.  This is done so that it
does not otherwise disturb your work.  If, however, you set the shell variable
<B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#notify">notify</A></B>, the shell will notify you immediately of changes of status in
background jobs.  There is also a shell command <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#notify">notify</A></I> which marks a
single process so that its status changes will be immediately reported.  By
default <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#notify">notify</A></I> marks the current process; simply say `notify' after
starting a background job to mark it.
<P>
When you try to leave the shell while jobs are stopped, you will be
warned that `There are suspended jobs.' You may use the <I><A HREF="Builtin_commands.html#jobs">jobs</A></I> command to
see what they are.  If you do this or immediately try to exit again, the shell
will not warn you a second time, and the suspended jobs will be terminated.
