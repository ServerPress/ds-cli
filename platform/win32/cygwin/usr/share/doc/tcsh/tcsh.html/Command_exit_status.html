<H2>Command exit status</H2>
Commands can be executed in expressions and their exit status
returned by enclosing them in braces (`{}').  Remember that the braces should
be separated from the words of the command by spaces.  Command executions
succeed, returning true, i.e., `1', if the command exits with status 0,
otherwise they fail, returning false, i.e., `0'.  If more detailed status
information is required then the command should be executed outside of an
expression and the <B><A HREF="Special_shell_variables.html#status">status</A></B> shell variable examined.
