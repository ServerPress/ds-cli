version 1.32; 2013-09-03

  * bugfix: don't get confused by a deleted stash when generating
    stack trace

  * bugfix: don't vivify @CARP_NOT and @ISA in caller's namespace

  * bugfix: don't generate Unicode warnings on old perls when an argument
    in a stack trace contains a non-character codepoint

  * in stack traces, consistently quote string arguments

  * in stack traces, new hookable mechanism for formatting reference
    arguments

  * document exportable subroutines longmess() and shortmess()

  * if Carp::Heavy gets loaded by a mismatched Carp (especially an
    older one that expects Carp::Heavy to do real work), give a useful
    error message

  * when truncating an argument list in a stack trace, don't format the
    arguments that got truncated

  * factor out non-vivifying subroutine lookup

  * regularise test for vivification of B::

  * in tests, avoid using package name "B" when not actually testing
    things relating to the B module

version 1.26; 2012-06-18

  * bugfix: get ", <fh> line 123" phrase from CORE::die, not allowing
    influence by any CORE::GLOBAL::die override, so that Carp can be
    used as part of a CORE::GLOBAL::die override

  * on VMS, skip some tests that rely on open3() which doesn't work
    there yet

version 1.25; 2012-02-16

  * bugfix: avoid failure to export to very old (Perl 5.6) versions of
    warnings.pm, which could occur due to circular dependency

  * bugfix: avoid vivifying "utf8" stash on Perl 5.6, which caused swash
    loading to fail in some situations

  * add dot to end of message from Carp, to match the formatting from
    CORE::die

  * synch Carp::Heavy version number to Carp

version 1.24; 2012-02-02

  * add ", <fh> line 123" phrase to messages, to match core die

version 1.23; 2011-09-09

  * bugfix: make Carp::Heavy load Carp, as it used to prior to 1.22,
    for backward compatibility

  * avoid " in Carp.t test programs, which caused false failures on
    Win32 due to faulty system()

version 1.22; 2011-09-04

  * first CPAN release
