.SH "NAME"
git-fast-export \- Git data exporter
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit fast\-export [options]\fR | \fIgit fast\-import\fR
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This program dumps the given revisions in a form suitable to be piped into \fIgit fast\-import\fR\&.
.sp
You can use it as a human\-readable bundle replacement (see \fBgit-bundle\fR(1)), or as a kind of an interactive \fIgit filter\-branch\fR\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-progress=<n>
.RS 4
Insert
\fIprogress\fR
statements every <n> objects, to be shown by
\fIgit fast\-import\fR
during import\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-signed\-tags=(verbatim|warn|warn\-strip|strip|abort)
.RS 4
Specify how to handle signed tags\&. Since any transformation after the export can change the tag names (which can also happen when excluding revisions) the signatures will not match\&.
.sp
When asking to
\fIabort\fR
(which is the default), this program will die when encountering a signed tag\&. With
\fIstrip\fR, the tags will silently be made unsigned, with
\fIwarn\-strip\fR
they will be made unsigned but a warning will be displayed, with
\fIverbatim\fR, they will be silently exported and with
\fIwarn\fR, they will be exported, but you will see a warning\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-tag\-of\-filtered\-object=(abort|drop|rewrite)
.RS 4
Specify how to handle tags whose tagged object is filtered out\&. Since revisions and files to export can be limited by path, tagged objects may be filtered completely\&.
.sp
When asking to
\fIabort\fR
(which is the default), this program will die when encountering such a tag\&. With
\fIdrop\fR
it will omit such tags from the output\&. With
\fIrewrite\fR, if the tagged object is a commit, it will rewrite the tag to tag an ancestor commit (via parent rewriting; see
\fBgit-rev-list\fR(1))
.RE
.PP
\-M, \-C
.RS 4
Perform move and/or copy detection, as described in the
\fBgit-diff\fR(1)
manual page, and use it to generate rename and copy commands in the output dump\&.
.sp
Note that earlier versions of this command did not complain and produced incorrect results if you gave these options\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-export\-marks=<file>
.RS 4
Dumps the internal marks table to <file> when complete\&. Marks are written one per line as
:markid SHA\-1\&. Only marks for revisions are dumped; marks for blobs are ignored\&. Backends can use this file to validate imports after they have been completed, or to save the marks table across incremental runs\&. As <file> is only opened and truncated at completion, the same path can also be safely given to \-\-import\-marks\&. The file will not be written if no new object has been marked/exported\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-import\-marks=<file>
.RS 4
Before processing any input, load the marks specified in <file>\&. The input file must exist, must be readable, and must use the same format as produced by \-\-export\-marks\&.
.sp
Any commits that have already been marked will not be exported again\&. If the backend uses a similar \-\-import\-marks file, this allows for incremental bidirectional exporting of the repository by keeping the marks the same across runs\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-fake\-missing\-tagger
.RS 4
Some old repositories have tags without a tagger\&. The fast\-import protocol was pretty strict about that, and did not allow that\&. So fake a tagger to be able to fast\-import the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-use\-done\-feature
.RS 4
Start the stream with a
\fIfeature done\fR
stanza, and terminate it with a
\fIdone\fR
command\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-data
.RS 4
Skip output of blob objects and instead refer to blobs via their original SHA\-1 hash\&. This is useful when rewriting the directory structure or history of a repository without touching the contents of individual files\&. Note that the resulting stream can only be used by a repository which already contains the necessary objects\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-tree
.RS 4
This option will cause fast\-export to issue a "deleteall" directive for each commit followed by a full list of all files in the commit (as opposed to just listing the files which are different from the commit\(cqs first parent)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-anonymize
.RS 4
Anonymize the contents of the repository while still retaining the shape of the history and stored tree\&. See the section on
ANONYMIZING
below\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-refspec
.RS 4
Apply the specified refspec to each ref exported\&. Multiple of them can be specified\&.
.RE
.PP
[<git\-rev\-list\-args>\&...]
.RS 4
A list of arguments, acceptable to
\fIgit rev\-parse\fR
and
\fIgit rev\-list\fR, that specifies the specific objects and references to export\&. For example,
master~10\&.\&.master
causes the current master reference to be exported along with all objects added since its 10th ancestor commit\&.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git fast\-export \-\-all | (cd /empty/repository && git fast\-import)
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This will export the whole repository and import it into the existing empty repository\&. Except for reencoding commits that are not in UTF\-8, it would be a one\-to\-one mirror\&.
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git fast\-export master~5\&.\&.master |
        sed "s|refs/heads/master|refs/heads/other|" |
        git fast\-import
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
This makes a new branch called \fIother\fR from \fImaster~5\&.\&.master\fR (i\&.e\&. if \fImaster\fR has linear history, it will take the last 5 commits)\&.
.sp
Note that this assumes that none of the blobs and commit messages referenced by that revision range contains the string \fIrefs/heads/master\fR\&.
.SH "ANONYMIZING"
.sp
If the \-\-anonymize option is given, git will attempt to remove all identifying information from the repository while still retaining enough of the original tree and history patterns to reproduce some bugs\&. The goal is that a git bug which is found on a private repository will persist in the anonymized repository, and the latter can be shared with git developers to help solve the bug\&.
.sp
With this option, git will replace all refnames, paths, blob contents, commit and tag messages, names, and email addresses in the output with anonymized data\&. Two instances of the same string will be replaced equivalently (e\&.g\&., two commits with the same author will have the same anonymized author in the output, but bear no resemblance to the original author string)\&. The relationship between commits, branches, and tags is retained, as well as the commit timestamps (but the commit messages and refnames bear no resemblance to the originals)\&. The relative makeup of the tree is retained (e\&.g\&., if you have a root tree with 10 files and 3 trees, so will the output), but their names and the contents of the files will be replaced\&.
.sp
If you think you have found a git bug, you can start by exporting an anonymized stream of the whole repository:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git fast\-export \-\-anonymize \-\-all >anon\-stream
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Then confirm that the bug persists in a repository created from that stream (many bugs will not, as they really do depend on the exact repository contents):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ git init anon\-repo
$ cd anon\-repo
$ git fast\-import <\&.\&./anon\-stream
$ \&.\&.\&. test your bug \&.\&.\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
If the anonymized repository shows the bug, it may be worth sharing anon\-stream along with a regular bug report\&. Note that the anonymized stream compresses very well, so gzipping it is encouraged\&. If you want to examine the stream to see that it does not contain any private data, you can peruse it directly before sending\&. You may also want to try:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
$ perl \-pe \*(Aqs/\ed+/X/g\*(Aq <anon\-stream | sort \-u | less
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
which shows all of the unique lines (with numbers converted to "X", to collapse "User 0", "User 1", etc into "User X")\&. This produces a much smaller output, and it is usually easy to quickly confirm that there is no private data in the stream\&.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.sp
Since \fIgit fast\-import\fR cannot tag trees, you will not be able to export the linux\&.git repository completely, as it contains a tag referencing a tree instead of a commit\&.
