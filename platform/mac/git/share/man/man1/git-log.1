.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit log\fR [<options>] [<revision range>] [[\-\-] <path>\&...]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Shows the commit logs\&.
.sp
The command takes options applicable to the git rev\-list command to control what is shown and how, and options applicable to the git diff\-* commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-follow
.RS 4
Continue listing the history of a file beyond renames (works only for a single file)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-decorate, \-\-decorate[=short|full|no]
.RS 4
Print out the ref names of any commits that are shown\&. If
\fIshort\fR
is specified, the ref name prefixes
\fIrefs/heads/\fR,
\fIrefs/tags/\fR
and
\fIrefs/remotes/\fR
will not be printed\&. If
\fIfull\fR
is specified, the full ref name (including prefix) will be printed\&. The default option is
\fIshort\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-source
.RS 4
Print out the ref name given on the command line by which each commit was reached\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-use\-mailmap
.RS 4
Use mailmap file to map author and committer names and email addresses to canonical real names and email addresses\&. See
\fBgit-shortlog\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-diff
.RS 4
Without this flag,
git log \-p <path>\&.\&.\&.
shows commits that touch the specified paths, and diffs about the same specified paths\&. With this, the full diff is shown for commits that touch the specified paths; this means that "<path>\&..." limits only commits, and doesn\(cqt limit diff for those commits\&.
.sp
Note that this affects all diff\-based output types, e\&.g\&. those produced by
\-\-stat, etc\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-log\-size
.RS 4
Include a line \(lqlog size <number>\(rq in the output for each commit, where <number> is the length of that commit\(cqs message in bytes\&. Intended to speed up tools that read log messages from
git log
output by allowing them to allocate space in advance\&.
.RE
.PP
\-L <start>,<end>:<file>, \-L :<funcname>:<file>
.RS 4
Trace the evolution of the line range given by "<start>,<end>" (or the function name regex <funcname>) within the <file>\&. You may not give any pathspec limiters\&. This is currently limited to a walk starting from a single revision, i\&.e\&., you may only give zero or one positive revision arguments\&. You can specify this option more than once\&.
.sp
<start> and <end> can take one of these forms:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
number
.sp
If <start> or <end> is a number, it specifies an absolute line number (lines count from 1)\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
/regex/
.sp
This form will use the first line matching the given POSIX regex\&. If <start> is a regex, it will search from the end of the previous
\-L
range, if any, otherwise from the start of file\&. If <start> is \(lq^/regex/\(rq, it will search from the start of file\&. If <end> is a regex, it will search starting at the line given by <start>\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
+offset or \-offset
.sp
This is only valid for <end> and will specify a number of lines before or after the line given by <start>\&.
.RE
.sp
If \(lq:<funcname>\(rq is given in place of <start> and <end>, it is a regular expression that denotes the range from the first funcname line that matches <funcname>, up to the next funcname line\&. \(lq:<funcname>\(rq searches from the end of the previous
\-L
range, if any, otherwise from the start of file\&. \(lq^:<funcname>\(rq searches from the start of file\&.
.RE
.PP
<revision range>
.RS 4
Show only commits in the specified revision range\&. When no <revision range> is specified, it defaults to
HEAD
(i\&.e\&. the whole history leading to the current commit)\&.
origin\&.\&.HEAD
specifies all the commits reachable from the current commit (i\&.e\&.
HEAD), but not from
origin\&. For a complete list of ways to spell <revision range>, see the
\fISpecifying Ranges\fR
section of
\fBgitrevisions\fR(7)\&.
.RE
.PP
[\-\-] <path>\&...
.RS 4
Show only commits that are enough to explain how the files that match the specified paths came to be\&. See
\fIHistory Simplification\fR
below for details and other simplification modes\&.
.sp
Paths may need to be prefixed with \(oq`\-\- \*(Aq\(cq to separate them from options or the revision range, when confusion arises\&.
.RE
.SS "Commit Limiting"
.sp
Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the special notations explained in the description, additional commit limiting may be applied\&.
.sp
Using more options generally further limits the output (e\&.g\&. \-\-since=<date1> limits to commits newer than <date1>, and using it with \-\-grep=<pattern> further limits to commits whose log message has a line that matches <pattern>), unless otherwise noted\&.
.sp
Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting options, such as \-\-reverse\&.
.PP
\-<number>, \-n <number>, \-\-max\-count=<number>
.RS 4
Limit the number of commits to output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-skip=<number>
.RS 4
Skip
\fInumber\fR
commits before starting to show the commit output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-since=<date>, \-\-after=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits more recent than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-until=<date>, \-\-before=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits older than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-author=<pattern>, \-\-committer=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that match the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\-\-author=<pattern>, commits whose author matches any of the given patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple
\-\-committer=<pattern>)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-grep\-reflog=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that match the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\-\-grep\-reflog, commits whose reflog message matches any of the given patterns are chosen\&. It is an error to use this option unless
\-\-walk\-reflogs
is in use\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-grep=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with log message that matches the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\-\-grep=<pattern>, commits whose message matches any of the given patterns are chosen (but see
\-\-all\-match)\&.
.sp
When
\-\-show\-notes
is in effect, the message from the notes is matched as if it were part of the log message\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-all\-match
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones that match all given
\-\-grep, instead of ones that match at least one\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-invert\-grep
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with log message that do not match the pattern specified with
\-\-grep=<pattern>\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i, \-\-regexp\-ignore\-case
.RS 4
Match the regular expression limiting patterns without regard to letter case\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-basic\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular expressions; this is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\-E, \-\-extended\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions instead of the default basic regular expressions\&.
.RE
.PP
\-F, \-\-fixed\-strings
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don\(cqt interpret pattern as a regular expression)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-perl\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl\-compatible regular expressions\&. Requires libpcre to be compiled in\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-remove\-empty
.RS 4
Stop when a given path disappears from the tree\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-merges
.RS 4
Print only merge commits\&. This is exactly the same as
\-\-min\-parents=2\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-merges
.RS 4
Do not print commits with more than one parent\&. This is exactly the same as
\-\-max\-parents=1\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-min\-parents=<number>, \-\-max\-parents=<number>, \-\-no\-min\-parents, \-\-no\-max\-parents
.RS 4
Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many parent commits\&. In particular,
\-\-max\-parents=1
is the same as
\-\-no\-merges,
\-\-min\-parents=2
is the same as
\-\-merges\&.
\-\-max\-parents=0
gives all root commits and
\-\-min\-parents=3
all octopus merges\&.
.sp
\-\-no\-min\-parents
and
\-\-no\-max\-parents
reset these limits (to no limit) again\&. Equivalent forms are
\-\-min\-parents=0
(any commit has 0 or more parents) and
\-\-max\-parents=\-1
(negative numbers denote no upper limit)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-first\-parent
.RS 4
Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit\&. This option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual commits brought in to your history by such a merge\&. Cannot be combined with \-\-bisect\&.

.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry\-pick
.RS 4
Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another commit on the \(lqother side\(rq when the set of commits are limited with symmetric difference\&.
.sp
For example, if you have two branches,
A
and
B, a usual way to list all commits on only one side of them is with
\-\-left\-right
(see the example below in the description of the
\-\-left\-right
option)\&. However, it shows the commits that were cherry\-picked from the other branch (for example, \(lq3rd on b\(rq may be cherry\-picked from branch A)\&. With this option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-left\-only, \-\-right\-only
.RS 4
List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric range, i\&.e\&. only those which would be marked
<
resp\&.
>
by
\-\-left\-right\&.
.sp
For example,
\-\-cherry\-pick \-\-right\-only A\&.\&.\&.B
omits those commits from
B
which are in
A
or are patch\-equivalent to a commit in
A\&. In other words, this lists the
+
commits from
git cherry A B\&. More precisely,
\-\-cherry\-pick \-\-right\-only \-\-no\-merges
gives the exact list\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry
.RS 4
A synonym for
\-\-right\-only \-\-cherry\-mark \-\-no\-merges; useful to limit the output to the commits on our side and mark those that have been applied to the other side of a forked history with
git log \-\-cherry upstream\&.\&.\&.mybranch, similar to
git cherry upstream mybranch\&.
.RE
.PP
\-g, \-\-walk\-reflogs
.RS 4
Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from the most recent one to older ones\&. When this option is used you cannot specify commits to exclude (that is,
\fI^commit\fR,
\fIcommit1\&.\&.commit2\fR, and
\fIcommit1\&.\&.\&.commit2\fR
notations cannot be used)\&.
.sp
With
\-\-pretty
format other than
oneline
(for obvious reasons), this causes the output to have two extra lines of information taken from the reflog\&. By default,
\fIcommit@{Nth}\fR
notation is used in the output\&. When the starting commit is specified as
\fIcommit@{now}\fR, output also uses
\fIcommit@{timestamp}\fR
notation instead\&. Under
\-\-pretty=oneline, the commit message is prefixed with this information on the same line\&. This option cannot be combined with
\-\-reverse\&. See also
\fBgit-reflog\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-merge
.RS 4
After a failed merge, show refs that touch files having a conflict and don\(cqt exist on all heads to merge\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-boundary
.RS 4
Output excluded boundary commits\&. Boundary commits are prefixed with
\-\&.
.RE
.SS "History Simplification"
.sp
Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for example the commits modifying a particular <path>\&. But there are two parts of \fIHistory Simplification\fR, one part is selecting the commits and the other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify the history\&.
.sp
The following options select the commits to be shown:
.PP
<paths>
.RS 4
Commits modifying the given <paths> are selected\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-simplify\-by\-decoration
.RS 4
Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are selected\&.
.RE
.sp
Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful history\&.
.sp
The following options affect the way the simplification is performed:
.PP
Default mode
.RS 4
Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining the final state of the tree\&. Simplest because it prunes some side branches if the end result is the same (i\&.e\&. merging branches with the same content)
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-history
.RS 4
Same as the default mode, but does not prune some history\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-dense
.RS 4
Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a meaningful history\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-sparse
.RS 4
All commits in the simplified history are shown\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-simplify\-merges
.RS 4
Additional option to
\-\-full\-history
to remove some needless merges from the resulting history, as there are no selected commits contributing to this merge\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ancestry\-path
.RS 4
When given a range of commits to display (e\&.g\&.
\fIcommit1\&.\&.commit2\fR
or
\fIcommit2 ^commit1\fR), only display commits that exist directly on the ancestry chain between the
\fIcommit1\fR
and
\fIcommit2\fR, i\&.e\&. commits that are both descendants of
\fIcommit1\fR, and ancestors of
\fIcommit2\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
A more detailed explanation follows\&.
.sp
Suppose you specified foo as the <paths>\&. We shall call commits that modify foo !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME\&. (In a diff filtered for foo, they look different and equal, respectively\&.)
.sp
In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to illustrate the differences between simplification settings\&. We assume that you are filtering for a file foo in this commit graph:

rev\-list walks backwards through history, including or excluding commits based on whether \-\-full\-history and/or parent rewriting (via \-\-parents or \-\-children) are used\&. The following settings are available\&.
.PP
Default mode
.RS 4
Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent (though this can be changed, see
\-\-sparse
below)\&. If the commit was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent\&. (Even if there are several TREESAME parents, follow only one of them\&.) Otherwise, follow all parents\&.
.sp
This results in:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
          \&.\-A\-\-\-N\-\-\-O
         /     /   /

.if n \{\

.\}
.sp
Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is available, removed
B
from consideration entirely\&.
C
was considered via
N, but is TREESAME\&. Root commits are compared to an empty tree, so
I
is !TREESAME\&.
.sp
Parent/child relations are only visible with
\-\-parents, but that does not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown the parent lines\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-history without parent rewriting
.RS 4
This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them\&. Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        I  A  B  N  D  O  P  Q
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
M
was excluded because it is TREESAME to both parents\&.
E,
C
and
B
were all walked, but only
B
was !TREESAME, so the others do not appear\&.
.sp
Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show them disconnected\&.

In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME affects inclusion:

Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent\&.

All commits that are walked are included\&.

\-\-full\-history, this still simplifies merges: if one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the other sides of the merge are never walked\&.

Replace each parent

The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to

Finally, there is a fifth simplification mode available:
.PP
\-\-ancestry\-path
.RS 4
Limit the displayed commits to those directly on the ancestry chain between the \(lqfrom\(rq and \(lqto\(rq commits in the given commit range\&. I\&.e\&. only display commits that are ancestor of the \(lqto\(rq commit and descendants of the \(lqfrom\(rq commit\&.
.sp
As an example use case, consider the following commit history:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
            D\-\-\-E\-\-\-\-\-\-\-F

A regular
\fID\&.\&.M\fR
computes the set of commits that are ancestors of

D\&. This is useful to see what happened to the history leading to
M
since
D, in the sense that \(lqwhat does

D\(rq\&. The result in this example would be all the commits, except
A
and
B
(and
D
itself, of course)\&.
.sp
When we want to find out what commits in

and need fixing, however, we might want to view only the subset of
\fID\&.\&.M\fR

D, i\&.e\&. excluding
C

K\&. This is exactly what the
\-\-ancestry\-path
option does\&. Applied to the
\fID\&.\&.M\fR

.sp
.if n \{\

The \-\-simplify\-by\-decoration option allows you to view only the big picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are not referenced by tags\&.

.sp
With
\-\-topo\-order, they would show 8 6 5 3 7 4 2 1 (or 8 7 4 2 6 5 3 1); some older commits are shown before newer ones in order to avoid showing the commits from two parallel development track mixed together\&.

\fItformat:\fR
.sp
The
\fItformat:\fR
format works exactly like
\fIformat:\fR, except that it provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics\&. In other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries\&. This means that the final entry of a single\-line format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
$ git log \-2 \-\-pretty=format:%h 4da45bef \e

.PP
changes
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the lines that have been removed from the source, or added to the destination\&. This ignores the amount of pure code movements within a file\&. In other words, rearranging lines in a file is not counted as much as other changes\&. This is the default behavior when no parameter is given\&.
.RE
.PP
lines
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by doing the regular line\-based diff analysis, and summing the removed/added line counts\&. (For binary files, count 64\-byte chunks instead, since binary files have no natural concept of lines)\&. This is a more expensive
\-\-dirstat
behavior than the
changes
behavior, but it does count rearranged lines within a file as much as other changes\&. The resulting output is consistent with what you get from the other
\-\-*stat

.RE
.PP
files
.RS 4
Compute the dirstat numbers by counting the number of files changed\&. Each changed file counts equally in the dirstat analysis\&. This is the computationally cheapest

Break complete rewrite changes into pairs of delete and create\&. This serves two purposes:
.sp
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new, and the number
m
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 60%)\&.
\-B/70%
specifies that less than 30% of the original should remain in the result for Git to consider it a total rewrite (i\&.e\&. otherwise the resulting patch will be a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with context lines)\&.
.sp
When used with \-M, a totally\-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a rename (usually \-M only considers a file that disappeared as the source of a rename), and the number
n
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 50%)\&.

If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each commit\&. For following files across renames while traversing history, see

n
is specified, it is a threshold on the similarity index (i\&.e\&. amount of addition/deletions compared to the file\(cqs size)\&. For example,
\-M90%
means Git should consider a delete/add pair to be a rename if more than 90% of the file hasn\(cqt changed\&. Without a
%
sign, the number is to be read as a fraction, with a decimal point before it\&. I\&.e\&.,
\-M5

Unlike the traditional \fIunified\fR diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single column that has \- (minus \(em appears in A but removed in B), + (plus \(em missing in A but added to B), or " " (space \(em unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files file1, file2,\&... with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN\&. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to note how X\(cqs line is different from it\&.

A \- character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result\&. A + character in the column N means that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that parent)\&.

Path names are encoded in UTF\-8 normalization form C\&. This applies to tree objects, the index file, ref names, as well as path names in command line arguments, environment variables and config files (\&.git/config
(see
\fBgit-config\fR(1)),
\fBgitignore\fR(5),
\fBgitattributes\fR(5)
and
\fBgitmodules\fR(5))\&.
.sp
Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as sequences of non\-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding conversions (except on Mac and Windows)\&. Therefore, using non\-ASCII path names will mostly work even on platforms and file systems that use legacy extended ASCII encodings\&. However, repositories created on such systems will not work properly on UTF\-8\-based systems (e\&.g\&. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa\&. Additionally, many Git\-based tools simply assume path names to be UTF\-8 and will fail to display other encodings correctly\&.

Commit log messages are typically encoded in UTF\-8, but other extended ASCII encodings are also supported\&. This includes ISO\-8859\-x, CP125x and many others, but
\fInot\fR
UTF\-16/32, EBCDIC and CJK multi\-byte encodings (GBK, Shift\-JIS, Big5, EUC\-x, CP9xx etc\&.)\&.
.RE
.sp
Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF\-8, both the core and Git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF\-8 on projects\&. If all participants of a particular project find it more convenient to use legacy encodings, Git does not forbid it\&. However, there are a few things to keep in mind\&.

\fIgit commit\fR
and
\fIgit commit\-tree\fR
issues a warning if the commit log message given to it does not look like a valid UTF\-8 string, unless you explicitly say your project uses a legacy encoding\&. The way to say this is to have i18n\&.commitencoding in
\&.git/config
file, like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[i18n]
        commitencoding = ISO\-8859\-1
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of
i18n\&.commitencoding
in its
encoding
header\&. This is to help other people who look at them later\&. Lack of this header implies that the commit log message is encoded in UTF\-8\&.

\fIgit log\fR,
\fIgit show\fR,
\fIgit blame\fR
and friends look at the
encoding
header of a commit object, and try to re\-code the log message into UTF\-8 unless otherwise specified\&. You can specify the desired output encoding with
i18n\&.logoutputencoding
in
\&.git/config
file, like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[i18n]
        logoutputencoding = ISO\-8859\-1
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
If you do not have this configuration variable, the value of
i18n\&.commitencoding
is used instead\&.
.RE
.sp
Note that we deliberately chose not to re\-code the commit log message when a commit is made to force UTF\-8 at the commit object level, because re\-coding to UTF\-8 is not necessarily a reversible operation\&.
