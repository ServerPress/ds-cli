.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
You can query/set/replace/unset options with this command\&. The name is actually the section and the key separated by a dot, and the value will be escaped\&.
.sp
Multiple lines can be added to an option by using the \fI\-\-add\fR option\&. If you want to update or unset an option which can occur on multiple lines, a POSIX regexp value_regex needs to be given\&. Only the existing values that match the regexp are updated or unset\&. If you want to handle the lines that do \fBnot\fR match the regex, just prepend a single exclamation mark in front (see also the section called \(lqEXAMPLES\(rq)\&.
.sp
The type specifier can be either \fI\-\-int\fR or \fI\-\-bool\fR, to make \fIgit config\fR ensure that the variable(s) are of the given type and convert the value to the canonical form (simple decimal number for int, a "true" or "false" string for bool), or \fI\-\-path\fR, which does some path expansion (see \fI\-\-path\fR below)\&. If no type specifier is passed, no checks or transformations are performed on the value\&.
.sp
When reading, the values are read from the system, global and repository local configuration files by default, and options \fI\-\-system\fR, \fI\-\-global\fR, \fI\-\-local\fR and \fI\-\-file <filename>\fR can be used to tell the command to read from only that location (see the section called \(lqFILES\(rq)\&.
.sp
When writing, the new value is written to the repository local configuration file by default, and options \fI\-\-system\fR, \fI\-\-global\fR, \fI\-\-file <filename>\fR can be used to tell the command to write to that location (you can say \fI\-\-local\fR but that is the default)\&.
.sp
This command will fail with non\-zero status upon error\&. Some exit codes are:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c

.RE
.sp
On success, the command returns the exit code 0\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-replace\-all
.RS 4
Default behavior is to replace at most one line\&. This replaces all lines matching the key (and optionally the value_regex)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-add
.RS 4
Adds a new line to the option without altering any existing values\&. This is the same as providing
\fI^$\fR
as the value_regex in
\-\-replace\-all\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-get
.RS 4
Get the value for a given key (optionally filtered by a regex matching the value)\&. Returns error code 1 if the key was not found and the last value if multiple key values were found\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-get\-all
.RS 4
Like get, but does not fail if the number of values for the key is not exactly one\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-get\-regexp
.RS 4
Like \-\-get\-all, but interprets the name as a regular expression and writes out the key names\&. Regular expression matching is currently case\-sensitive and done against a canonicalized version of the key in which section and variable names are lowercased, but subsection names are not\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-get\-urlmatch name URL
.RS 4
When given a two\-part name section\&.key, the value for section\&.<url>\&.key whose <url> part matches the best to the given URL is returned (if no such key exists, the value for section\&.key is used as a fallback)\&. When given just the section as name, do so for all the keys in the section and list them\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-global
.RS 4
For writing options: write to global
~/\&.gitconfig
file rather than the repository
\&.git/config, write to
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config
file if this file exists and the
~/\&.gitconfig
file doesn\(cqt\&.
.sp
For reading options: read only from global
~/\&.gitconfig
and from
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config
rather than from all available files\&.
.sp
See also
the section called \(lqFILES\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-system
.RS 4
For writing options: write to system\-wide
$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig
rather than the repository
\&.git/config\&.
.sp
For reading options: read only from system\-wide
$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig
rather than from all available files\&.
.sp
See also
the section called \(lqFILES\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-local
.RS 4
For writing options: write to the repository
\&.git/config
file\&. This is the default behavior\&.
.sp
For reading options: read only from the repository
\&.git/config
rather than from all available files\&.
.sp
See also
the section called \(lqFILES\(rq\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f config\-file, \-\-file config\-file
.RS 4
Use the given config file instead of the one specified by GIT_CONFIG\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-blob blob
.RS 4
Similar to
\fI\-\-file\fR
but use the given blob instead of a file\&. E\&.g\&. you can use
\fImaster:\&.gitmodules\fR
to read values from the file
\fI\&.gitmodules\fR
in the master branch\&. See "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in
\fBgitrevisions\fR(7)
for a more complete list of ways to spell blob names\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-remove\-section
.RS 4
Remove the given section from the configuration file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-rename\-section
.RS 4
Rename the given section to a new name\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-unset
.RS 4
Remove the line matching the key from config file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-unset\-all
.RS 4
Remove all lines matching the key from config file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-l, \-\-list
.RS 4
List all variables set in config file, along with their values\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bool
.RS 4
\fIgit config\fR
will ensure that the output is "true" or "false"
.RE
.PP
\-\-int
.RS 4
\fIgit config\fR
will ensure that the output is a simple decimal number\&. An optional value suffix of
\fIk\fR,
\fIm\fR, or
\fIg\fR
in the config file will cause the value to be multiplied by 1024, 1048576, or 1073741824 prior to output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bool\-or\-int
.RS 4
\fIgit config\fR
will ensure that the output matches the format of either \-\-bool or \-\-int, as described above\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-path
.RS 4
\fIgit\-config\fR
will expand leading
\fI~\fR
to the value of
\fI$HOME\fR, and
\fI~user\fR
to the home directory for the specified user\&. This option has no effect when setting the value (but you can use
\fIgit config bla ~/\fR
from the command line to let your shell do the expansion)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-z, \-\-null
.RS 4
For all options that output values and/or keys, always end values with the null character (instead of a newline)\&. Use newline instead as a delimiter between key and value\&. This allows for secure parsing of the output without getting confused e\&.g\&. by values that contain line breaks\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-name\-only
.RS 4
Output only the names of config variables for
\-\-list
or
\-\-get\-regexp\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-get\-colorbool name [stdout\-is\-tty]
.RS 4
Find the color setting for
name
(e\&.g\&.
color\&.diff) and output "true" or "false"\&.
stdout\-is\-tty
should be either "true" or "false", and is taken into account when configuration says "auto"\&. If
stdout\-is\-tty
is missing, then checks the standard output of the command itself, and exits with status 0 if color is to be used, or exits with status 1 otherwise\&. When the color setting for
name
is undefined, the command uses
color\&.ui
as fallback\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-get\-color name [default]
.RS 4
Find the color configured for
name
(e\&.g\&.
color\&.diff\&.new) and output it as the ANSI color escape sequence to the standard output\&. The optional
default
parameter is used instead, if there is no color configured for
name\&.
.RE
.PP
\-e, \-\-edit
.RS 4
Opens an editor to modify the specified config file; either
\fI\-\-system\fR,
\fI\-\-global\fR, or repository (default)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-[no\-]includes
.RS 4
Respect
include\&.*
directives in config files when looking up values\&. Defaults to on\&.
.RE
.SH "FILES"
.sp
If not set explicitly with \fI\-\-file\fR, there are four files where \fIgit config\fR will search for configuration options:
.PP
$(prefix)/etc/gitconfig
.RS 4
System\-wide configuration file\&.
.RE
.PP
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/config
.RS 4
Second user\-specific configuration file\&. If $XDG_CONFIG_HOME is not set or empty,
$HOME/\&.config/git/config
will be used\&. Any single\-valued variable set in this file will be overwritten by whatever is in
~/\&.gitconfig\&. It is a good idea not to create this file if you sometimes use older versions of Git, as support for this file was added fairly recently\&.
.RE
.PP
~/\&.gitconfig
.RS 4
User\-specific configuration file\&. Also called "global" configuration file\&.
.RE
.PP
$GIT_DIR/config
.RS 4
Repository specific configuration file\&.
.RE
.sp
If no further options are given, all reading options will read all of these files that are available\&. If the global or the system\-wide configuration file are not available they will be ignored\&. If the repository configuration file is not available or readable, \fIgit config\fR will exit with a non\-zero error code\&. However, in neither case will an error message be issued\&.
.sp
The files are read in the order given above, with last value found taking precedence over values read earlier\&. When multiple values are taken then all values of a key from all files will be used\&.
.sp
All writing options will per default write to the repository specific configuration file\&. Note that this also affects options like \fI\-\-replace\-all\fR and \fI\-\-unset\fR\&. \fB\fIgit config\fR\fR\fB will only ever change one file at a time\fR\&.
.sp
You can override these rules either by command\-line options or by environment variables\&. The \fI\-\-global\fR and the \fI\-\-system\fR options will limit the file used to the global or system\-wide file respectively\&. The GIT_CONFIG environment variable has a similar effect, but you can specify any filename you want\&.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
GIT_CONFIG
.RS 4
Take the configuration from the given file instead of \&.git/config\&. Using the "\-\-global" option forces this to ~/\&.gitconfig\&. Using the "\-\-system" option forces this to $(prefix)/etc/gitconfig\&.
.RE

.SH "CONFIGURATION FILE"
.sp
The Git configuration file contains a number of variables that affect the Git commands\*(Aq behavior\&. The \&.git/config file in each repository is used to store the configuration for that repository, and $HOME/\&.gitconfig is used to store a per\-user configuration as fallback values for the \&.git/config file\&. The file /etc/gitconfig can be used to store a system\-wide default configuration\&.
.sp
The configuration variables are used by both the Git plumbing and the porcelains\&. The variables are divided into sections, wherein the fully qualified variable name of the variable itself is the last dot\-separated segment and the section name is everything before the last dot\&. The variable names are case\-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters and \-, and must start with an alphabetic character\&. Some variables may appear multiple times; we say then that the variable is multivalued\&.
.SS "Syntax"
.sp
The syntax is fairly flexible and permissive; whitespaces are mostly ignored\&. The \fI#\fR and \fI;\fR characters begin comments to the end of line, blank lines are ignored\&.
.sp
The file consists of sections and variables\&. A section begins with the name of the section in square brackets and continues until the next section begins\&. Section names are case\-insensitive\&. Only alphanumeric characters, \- and \&. are allowed in section names\&. Each variable must belong to some section, which means that there must be a section header before the first setting of a variable\&.
.sp
Sections can be further divided into subsections\&. To begin a subsection put its name in double quotes, separated by space from the section name, in the section header, like in the example below:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        [section "subsection"]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Subsection names are case sensitive and can contain any characters except newline (doublequote " and backslash can be included by escaping them as \e" and \e\e, respectively)\&. Section headers cannot span multiple lines\&. Variables may belong directly to a section or to a given subsection\&. You can have [section] if you have [section "subsection"], but you don\(cqt need to\&.
.sp
There is also a deprecated [section\&.subsection] syntax\&. With this syntax, the subsection name is converted to lower\-case and is also compared case sensitively\&. These subsection names follow the same restrictions as section names\&.
.sp
All the other lines (and the remainder of the line after the section header) are recognized as setting variables, in the form \fIname = value\fR (or just \fIname\fR, which is a short\-hand to say that the variable is the boolean "true")\&. The variable names are case\-insensitive, allow only alphanumeric characters and \-, and must start with an alphabetic character\&.
.sp
A line that defines a value can be continued to the next line by ending it with a \e; the backquote and the end\-of\-line are stripped\&. Leading whitespaces after \fIname =\fR, the remainder of the line after the first comment character \fI#\fR or \fI;\fR, and trailing whitespaces of the line are discarded unless they are enclosed in double quotes\&. Internal whitespaces within the value are retained verbatim\&.
.sp
Inside double quotes, double quote " and backslash \e characters must be escaped: use \e" for " and \e\e for \e\&.
.sp
The following escape sequences (beside \e" and \e\e) are recognized: \en for newline character (NL), \et for horizontal tabulation (HT, TAB) and \eb for backspace (BS)\&. Other char escape sequences (including octal escape sequences) are invalid\&.
.SS "Includes"
.sp
You can include one config file from another by setting the special include\&.path variable to the name of the file to be included\&. The included file is expanded immediately, as if its contents had been found at the location of the include directive\&. If the value of the include\&.path variable is a relative path, the path is considered to be relative to the configuration file in which the include directive was found\&. The value of include\&.path is subject to tilde expansion: ~/ is expanded to the value of $HOME, and ~user/ to the specified user\(cqs home directory\&. See below for examples\&.

core\&.safecrlf
.RS 4
If true, makes Git check if converting
CRLF
is reversible when end\-of\-line conversion is active\&. Git will verify if a command modifies a file in the work tree either directly or indirectly\&. For example, committing a file followed by checking out the same file should yield the original file in the work tree\&. If this is not the case for the current setting of
core\&.autocrlf, Git will reject the file\&. The variable can be set to "warn", in which case Git will only warn about an irreversible conversion but continue the operation\&.
.sp
CRLF conversion bears a slight chance of corrupting data\&. When it is enabled, Git will convert CRLF to LF during commit and LF to CRLF during checkout\&. A file that contains a mixture of LF and CRLF before the commit cannot be recreated by Git\&. For text files this is the right thing to do: it corrects line endings such that we have only LF line endings in the repository\&. But for binary files that are accidentally classified as text the conversion can corrupt data\&.
.sp
If you recognize such corruption early you can easily fix it by setting the conversion type explicitly in \&.gitattributes\&. Right after committing you still have the original file in your work tree and this file is not yet corrupted\&. You can explicitly tell Git that this file is binary and Git will handle the file appropriately\&.
.sp
Unfortunately, the desired effect of cleaning up text files with mixed line endings and the undesired effect of corrupting binary files cannot be distinguished\&. In both cases CRLFs are removed in an irreversible way\&. For text files this is the right thing to do because CRLFs are line endings, while for binary files converting CRLFs corrupts data\&.
.sp
Note, this safety check does not mean that a checkout will generate a file identical to the original file for a different setting of
core\&.eol
and
core\&.autocrlf, but only for the current one\&. For example, a text file with
LF
would be accepted with
core\&.eol=lf
and could later be checked out with
core\&.eol=crlf, in which case the resulting file would contain
CRLF, although the original file contained
LF\&. However, in both work trees the line endings would be consistent, that is either all
LF
or all
CRLF, but never mixed\&. A file with mixed line endings would be reported by the
core\&.safecrlf
mechanism\&.
.RE
.PP
core\&.autocrlf

Setting this variable to "true" is almost the same as setting the

CRLF
in the repository will not be touched\&. Use this setting if you want to have

foo/
matches URL path
foo/bar\&. A prefix can only match on a slash (/) boundary\&. Longer matches take precedence (so a config key with path

User name (e\&.g\&.,

If the config key does not have a user name, that config key will match a URL with any user name (including none), but at a lower precedence than a config key with a user name\&.

The list above is ordered by decreasing precedence; a URL that matches a config key\(cqs path is preferred to one that matches its user name\&. For example, if the URL is
https://user@example\&.com/foo/bar

https://example\&.com/foo

https://user@example\&.com\&.

All URLs are normalized before attempting any matching (the password part, if embedded in the URL, is always ignored for matching purposes) so that equivalent URLs that are simply spelled differently will match properly\&. Environment variable settings always override any matches\&. The URLs that are matched against are those given directly to Git commands\&. This means any URLs visited as a result of a redirection do not participate in matching\&.

.RE
.PP
submodule\&.<name>\&.ignore
.RS 4
Defines under what circumstances "git status" and the diff family show a submodule as modified\&. When set to "all", it will never be considered modified (but it will nonetheless show up in the output of status and commit when it has been staged), "dirty" will ignore all changes to the submodules work tree and takes only differences between the HEAD of the submodule and the commit recorded in the superproject into account\&. "untracked" will additionally let submodules with modified tracked files in their work tree show up\&. Using "none" (the default when this option is not set) also shows submodules that have untracked files in their work tree as changed\&. This setting overrides any setting made in \&.gitmodules for this submodule, both settings can be overridden on the command line by using the "\-\-ignore\-submodules" option\&. The
