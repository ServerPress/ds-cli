.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an unusually rich command set that provides both high\-level operations and full access to internals\&.
.sp
See \fBgittutorial\fR(7) to get started, then see \fBgiteveryday\fR(7) for a useful minimum set of commands\&. The \m[blue]\fBGit User\(cqs Manual\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2 has a more in\-depth introduction\&.
.sp
After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page to learn what commands Git offers\&. You can learn more about individual Git commands with "git help command"\&. \fBgitcli\fR(7) manual page gives you an overview of the command\-line command syntax\&.
.sp
Formatted and hyperlinked version of the latest Git documentation can be viewed at http://git\-htmldocs\&.googlecode\&.com/git/git\&.html\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-\-version
.RS 4
Prints the Git suite version that the
\fIgit\fR
program came from\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-help
.RS 4
Prints the synopsis and a list of the most commonly used commands\&. If the option
\fI\-\-all\fR
or
\fI\-a\fR
is given then all available commands are printed\&. If a Git command is named this option will bring up the manual page for that command\&.
.sp
Other options are available to control how the manual page is displayed\&. See
\fBgit-help\fR(1)
for more information, because
git \-\-help \&.\&.\&.
is converted internally into
git help \&.\&.\&.\&.
.RE
.PP
\-C <path>
.RS 4
Run as if git was started in
\fI<path>\fR
instead of the current working directory\&. When multiple
\-C
options are given, each subsequent non\-absolute
\-C <path>
is interpreted relative to the preceding
\-C <path>\&.
.sp
This option affects options that expect path name like
\-\-git\-dir
and
\-\-work\-tree
in that their interpretations of the path names would be made relative to the working directory caused by the
\-C
option\&. For example the following invocations are equivalent:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
git \-\-git\-dir=a\&.git \-\-work\-tree=b \-C c status
git \-\-git\-dir=c/a\&.git \-\-work\-tree=c/b status
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\-c <name>=<value>
.RS 4
Pass a configuration parameter to the command\&. The value given will override values from configuration files\&. The <name> is expected in the same format as listed by
\fIgit config\fR
(subkeys separated by dots)\&.
.sp
Note that omitting the
=
in
git \-c foo\&.bar \&.\&.\&.
is allowed and sets
foo\&.bar
to the boolean true value (just like
[foo]bar
would in a config file)\&. Including the equals but with an empty value (like
git \-c foo\&.bar= \&.\&.\&.) sets
foo\&.bar
to the empty string\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exec\-path[=<path>]
.RS 4
Path to wherever your core Git programs are installed\&. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_EXEC_PATH environment variable\&. If no path is given,
\fIgit\fR
will print the current setting and then exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-html\-path
.RS 4
Print the path, without trailing slash, where Git\(cqs HTML documentation is installed and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-man\-path
.RS 4
Print the manpath (see
man(1)) for the man pages for this version of Git and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-info\-path
.RS 4
Print the path where the Info files documenting this version of Git are installed and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-p, \-\-paginate
.RS 4
Pipe all output into
\fIless\fR
(or if set, $PAGER) if standard output is a terminal\&. This overrides the
pager\&.<cmd>
configuration options (see the "Configuration Mechanism" section below)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-pager
.RS 4
Do not pipe Git output into a pager\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-git\-dir=<path>
.RS 4
Set the path to the repository\&. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_DIR environment variable\&. It can be an absolute path or relative path to current working directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-work\-tree=<path>
.RS 4
Set the path to the working tree\&. It can be an absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory\&. This can also be controlled by setting the GIT_WORK_TREE environment variable and the core\&.worktree configuration variable (see core\&.worktree in
\fBgit-config\fR(1)
for a more detailed discussion)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-namespace=<path>
.RS 4
Set the Git namespace\&. See
\fBgitnamespaces\fR(7)
for more details\&. Equivalent to setting the
GIT_NAMESPACE
environment variable\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-bare
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-replace\-objects
.RS 4

\fBgit-replace\fR(1)
for more information\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-literal\-pathspecs
.RS 4

GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS
environment variable to
1\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-glob\-pathspecs
.RS 4
Add "glob" magic to all pathspec\&. This is equivalent to setting the
GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS
environment variable to
1\&. Disabling globbing on individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec magic ":(literal)"
.RE
.PP
\-\-noglob\-pathspecs
.RS 4
Add "literal" magic to all pathspec\&. This is equivalent to setting the
GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS
environment variable to
1\&. Enabling globbing on individual pathspecs can be done using pathspec magic ":(glob)"
.RE
.PP
\-\-icase\-pathspecs
.RS 4
Add "icase" magic to all pathspec\&. This is equivalent to setting the
GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS
environment variable to
1\&.

.SH "LOW-LEVEL COMMANDS (PLUMBING)"
.sp
Although Git includes its own porcelain layer, its low\-level commands are sufficient to support development of alternative porcelains\&. Developers of such porcelains might start by reading about \fBgit-update-index\fR(1) and \fBgit-read-tree\fR(1)\&.
.sp
The interface (input, output, set of options and the semantics) to these low\-level commands are meant to be a lot more stable than Porcelain level commands, because these commands are primarily for scripted use\&. The interface to Porcelain commands on the other hand are subject to change in order to improve the end user experience\&.

It will not exclude the current working directory or a GIT_DIR set on the command line or in the environment\&. Normally, Git has to read the entries in this list and resolve any symlink that might be present in order to compare them with the current directory\&. However, if even this access is slow, you can add an empty entry to the list to tell Git that the subsequent entries are not symlinks and needn\(cqt be resolved; e\&.g\&.,

.SH "DISCUSSION"
.sp
More detail on the following is available from the \m[blue]\fBGit concepts chapter of the user\-manual\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[2]\d\s+2 and \fBgitcore-tutorial\fR(7)\&.
.sp
A Git project normally consists of a working directory with a "\&.git" subdirectory at the top level\&. The \&.git directory contains, among other things, a compressed object database representing the complete history of the project, an "index" file which links that history to the current contents of the working tree, and named pointers into that history such as tags and branch heads\&.
.sp
The object database contains objects of three main types: blobs, which hold file data; trees, which point to blobs and other trees to build up directory hierarchies; and commits, which each reference a single tree and some number of parent commits\&.
.sp
The commit, equivalent to what other systems call a "changeset" or "version", represents a step in the project\(cqs history, and each parent represents an immediately preceding step\&. Commits with more than one parent represent merges of independent lines of development\&.
.sp
All objects are named by the SHA\-1 hash of their contents, normally written as a string of 40 hex digits\&. Such names are globally unique\&. The entire history leading up to a commit can be vouched for by signing just that commit\&. A fourth object type, the tag, is provided for this purpose\&.
.sp
When first created, objects are stored in individual files, but for efficiency may later be compressed together into "pack files"\&.
.sp
Named pointers called refs mark interesting points in history\&. A ref may contain the SHA\-1 name of an object or the name of another ref\&. Refs with names beginning ref/head/ contain the SHA\-1 name of the most recent commit (or "head") of a branch under development\&. SHA\-1 names of tags of interest are stored under ref/tags/\&. A special ref named HEAD contains the name of the currently checked\-out branch\&.
.sp
The index file is initialized with a list of all paths and, for each path, a blob object and a set of attributes\&. The blob object represents the contents of the file as of the head of the current branch\&. The attributes (last modified time, size, etc\&.) are taken from the corresponding file in the working tree\&. Subsequent changes to the working tree can be found by comparing these attributes\&. The index may be updated with new content, and new commits may be created from the content stored in the index\&.
.sp
The index is also capable of storing multiple entries (called "stages") for a given pathname\&. These stages are used to hold the various unmerged version of a file when a merge is in progress\&.
