description         Xdelta -- A binary delta generator (old stable maintenance release)
long_description \
    Xdelta is an application program designed to compute changes \
    between files. These changes (deltas) are similar to the output \
    of the \"diff\" program in that they may be used to store and \
    transmit only the changes between files. However, unlike diff, \
    the output of Xdelta is not expressed in a human-readable \
    format--Xdelta can also also apply these deltas to a copy \
    of the original file. Xdelta uses a fast, linear algorithm and \
    performs well on both binary and text files. This is a port of the \
    old stable Xdelta-1.1 maintenance release series. New development \
    happens in the Xdelta-3.0 release series, which is available via \
    the \"xdelta\" port.
