description     'FireWall KNock OPerator': a port knocker to Linux servers

long_description \
    fwknop stands for the 'FireWall KNock OPerator', and implements an \
    authorization scheme called Single Packet Authorization (SPA) that \
    is based around Netfilter and libpcap.  SPA requires only a single \
    encrypted packet in order to communicate various pieces of \
    information including desired access through a Netfilter policy \
    and/or complete commands to execute on the target system.  By \
    using Netfilter to maintain a 'default drop' stance, the main \
    application of this program is to protect services such as OpenSSH \
    with an additional layer of security in order to make the \
    exploitation of vulnerabilities (both 0-day and unpatched code) \
    much more difficult.  The authorization server passively monitors \
    authorization packets via libcap and hence there is no 'server' to \
    which to connect in the traditional sense.  Access to a protected \
    service is only granted after a valid encrypted and non-replayed \
    packet is monitored.  This port installs the client side script \
    that you run to gain access to a Linux box.
