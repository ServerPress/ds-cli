-Copyright (C) 1990-1997 Pretty Good Privacy, Inc.\n\
-All Rights Reserved.\n\
-\n\
-End User License Agreement for PGP Client Software\n\
-\n\
-\n\
-IMPORTANT-READ CAREFULLY: This PGP End-User License Agreement\n\
-(\"Agreement\") is a legal agreement between you (either an individual\n\
-or a single entity) and Pretty Good Privacy, Inc. (or \"PGP\") for the\n\
-PGP software product identified above, which includes computer software\n\
-and may include associated media, printed materials, and \"online\" or\n\
-electronic documentation (\"Software Product\"). By installing, copying,\n\
-or otherwise using the Software Product, you agree to be bound by the\n\
-terms of this Agreement. If you do not agree to the terms of this\n\
-Agreement, you may not install or use the Software Product; you may,\n\
-however, return it to your place of purchase for a full refund.\n\
-\n\
-The Software Product is owned by Pretty Good Privacy, Inc. and is\n\
-protected by copyright laws and international copyright treaties, as well as\n\
-other intellectual property laws and treaties.\n\
-\n\
-1.      GRANT OF LICENSE.  PGP grants you (the original end-user and any\n\
-subsequent transferee of the Software Product as permitted below) a\n\
-non-exclusive license to put in use by a person or organization that agrees\n\
-to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, one copy of the Software\n\
-Product. The Software Product is \"in use\" when it is loaded into the\n\
-temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into the permanent memory (e.g.,\n\
-hard disk, CD ROM, or other storage device) of a computer or workstation for\n\
-the purpose of being accessible in client-mode by one end user.  (If you\n\
-wish to use the Software Product on a computer or workstation in\n\
-server-mode within a multi-user or networked environment, then you must\n\
-obtain a server-mode license from PGP, which will require that you license\n\
-one copy of the Software Product for each computer or workstation which is\n\
-participating in such an environment and which has access to the Software\n\
-Product).\n\
-\n\
-        Volume Licenses.  If this package is a volume license package (such\n\
-as a \"corporate license\" or a \"corporate bundle\"), you may make and use\n\
-additional copies of the Software Product up to the number of copies\n\
-authorized in this package or in your corporate license agreement, or\n\
-otherwise at the time of purchase. If the anticipated number of users of the\n\
-Software Product will exceed the number of applicable licenses, then you\n\
-must have a reasonable mechanism or process in place to ensure that the\n\
-number of persons using the Software Product does not exceed the number of\n\
-licenses you have obtained.\n\
-\n\
-Home Use.  If the Software Product is permanently installed on the hard disk\n\
-or other storage device of a computer (other than a network server) and one\n\
-person uses that computer more than 80%% of the time it is in use, then that\n\
-person may also install and use the Software Product on a portable or home\n\
-computer.\n\
-\n\
-2.      COPYRIGHT. The Software Product is licensed, not sold. All right,\n\
-title and interest in the Software Product (including any images,\n\
-\"applets,\" photographs, animations, video, audio, music, and text\n\
-incorporated into the software), accompanying printed materials, and any\n\
-copies you are permitted to make herein, are owned by PGP or its suppliers,\n\
-and the Software Product is protected by United States copyright laws and\n\
-international treaty provisions.  Therefore, you must treat the Software\n\
-Product like any other copyrighted material (e.g., a book or musical\n\
-recording) except that you may either (a) make one copy of the Software\n\
-Product solely for backup or archival purposes or (b) transfer the\n\
-Software Product to a single hard disk, provided you keep the original\n\
-solely for backup or archival purposes.  Such copy shall include PGP's\n\
-copyright and other proprietary notices.  You may not copy the printed\n\
-materials accompanying the Software Product. 
-\n\
-3.      UPGRADES AND SUPPORT.  If this Software Product is labeled as an\n\
-upgrade or trade-up from a prior version of a PGP product that you were\n\
-properly licensed to use, PGP grants you the right to put in use either the\n\
-current or prior version of the Software Product, and any prior version\n\
-license is replaced by this Agreement. Subject to U.S. export control laws\n\
-and regulations, PGP may provide you with technical support services\n\
-relating to the Software Product according to PGP's standard support\n\
-policies and procedures, which may be described in the user manual, in \"on\n\
-line\" documentation and/or other materials provided by PGP or posted on\n\
-PGP's web site (\"Support Services\"). Any supplemental software code\n\
-provided to you as part of the Support Services shall be considered part of\n\
-the Software Product and subject to the terms and conditions of this\n\
-Agreement. With respect to technical information you provide to PGP as\n\
-part of the Support Services, PGP may use such information for its\n\
-business purposes, including for product support and development. PGP will\n\
-not utilize such technical information in a form that personally\n\
-identifies you.\n\
-\n\
-4.      OTHER RESTRICTIONS.  The original of this Agreement is your proof of\n\
-license to exercise the rights granted herein and must be retained by you.\n\
-You may not rent or lease the Software Product, but you may transfer your\n\
-rights under this Agreement on a permanent basis provided you transfer this\n\
-Agreement and all copies of the Software Product, including all accompanying\n\
-printed materials, you do not retain any copies of the Software Product or\n\
-such materials, and the recipient agrees to be bound by the terms of this\n\
-Agreement.  Any transfer of the Software must include the most recent\n\
-update and all prior revisions. You may not reverse engineer, decompile,\n\
-disassemble or otherwise translate the Software Product, except and only to\n\
-the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law\n\
-notwithstanding this limitation. If this Software Product is labeled\n\
-\"Evaluation Copy,\" \"Not For Resale,\" \"NFR\" or to any of those\n\
-effects, this license only permits use for demonstration, test, or\n\
-evaluation purposes.\n\
-\n\
-5.      DUAL MEDIA SOFTWARE AND MULTIPLE PLATFORM VERSION.  If the package\n\
-from which you obtained this Software Product contains more than one medium\n\
-(e.g., both 3 1/2\" disks and a CD), you may use only the medium appropriate\n\
-to your computer. You may not use the other disk(s) on another computer or\n\
-loan, rent, lease, or transfer them to another user except as permitted\n\
-under this Agreement or as part of the permanent transfer (as provided\n\
-above) of all the Software Product and related materials.  If the CD or\n\
-disk(s) on which the Software Product resides contains several copies of the\n\
-Software Product, each of which is compatible with a different operating\n\
-system or platform architecture (such as Windows95/NT, Macintosh, one or\n\
-more versions of Unix, the x86 architecture, or various RISC architectures),\n\
-then you may install the Software Product for use with only one of those\n\
-architectures and you may not use the other version(s) on another computer\n\
-or loan, rent, lease, or transfer them to another user except as permitted\n\
-under this Agreement or as part of a permanent transfer (as provided above).\n\
-\n\

-this Agreement.  You agree upon termination to promptly destroy the Software\n\
-Product together with all of its component parts and all copies,\n\

-\n\
-8.      LIMITED WARRANTY.  PGP warrants that the Software Product will\n\

-has resulted from accident, abuse, or misapplication.  Any repaired or\n\
-replacement Software Product will be warranted for the remainder of the\n\
-original warranty period or 30 days, whichever is longer.  IF THE SOFTWARE\n\
-PRODUCT IS EXPORT CONTROLLED (SEE BELOW), THESE REMEDIES MAY NOT BE\n\

-THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND PGP DISCLAIMS ALL\n\
-OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO\n\

-compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated regulations from time\n\
-to time by the Bureau of Export Administration, United States Department of\n\
-Commerce, which restrict the export and re-export of certain products and\n\
