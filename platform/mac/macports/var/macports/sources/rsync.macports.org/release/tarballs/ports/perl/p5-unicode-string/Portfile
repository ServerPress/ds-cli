description           String of Unicode characters (UCS2/UTF16)
long_description      A Unicode::String object represents a sequence of \
                      Unicode characters. The Unicode Standard is a \
                      fixed-width, uniform encoding scheme for written \
                      characters and text. This encoding treats alphabetic \
                      characters, ideographic characters, and symbols \
                      identically, which means that they can be used in any \
                      mixture and with equal facility. Unicode is modeled on \
                      the ASCII character set, but uses a 16-bit encoding to \
                      support full multilingual text.
