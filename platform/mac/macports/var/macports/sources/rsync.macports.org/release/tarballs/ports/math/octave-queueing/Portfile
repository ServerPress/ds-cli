description         The queueing package provides functions for queueing networks and \
                    Markov chains analysis.
long_description    ${description}This package can be used to compute steady-state \
                    performance measures for open, closed and mixed networks with single \
                    or multiple job classes. Mean Value Analysis (MVA), convolution, and \
                    various bounding techniques are implemented. Furthermore, several \
                    transient and steady-state performance measures for Markov chains \
                    can be computed, such as state occupancy probabilities, mean time to \
                    absorption, time-averaged sojourn times and so forth. Discrete- and \
                    continuous-time Markov chains are supported.
