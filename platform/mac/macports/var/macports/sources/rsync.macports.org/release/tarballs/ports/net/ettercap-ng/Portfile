description         multipurpose sniffer/interceptor/logger for switched LAN

long_description \
    Ettercap is a multi-functional packet sniffer/interceptor/logger \
    that works on switched LANs. It allows the active and passive \
    dissection of numerous protocols, including ciphered ones, such as \
    SSH1, and includes features for network and host analysis. Four \
    modes are available: IP Based, MAC Address Based, ARP Based, and \
    PublicARP Based.
