description         mainline bitcoind from Satoshi github source installing a node for the BTC peer-to-peer digital currency
long_description    Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer digital currency. By peer-to-peer,  \
                    we mean that there is no central authority to issue \
                    new Bitcoins or keep track of transactions. Instead, these \
                    tasks are managed collectively by the Bitcoin protocol \
                    operating through the nodes of the network.
