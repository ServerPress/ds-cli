description         commandline flags module for C++
long_description    The gflags package contains a library that implements commandline flags processing. \
                    As such it's a replacement for getopt(). It has increased flexibility, \
                    including built-in support for C++ types like string, and \
                    the ability to define flags in the source file in which \
                    they're used.
