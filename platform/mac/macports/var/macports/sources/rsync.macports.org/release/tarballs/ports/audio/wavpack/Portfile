description         Hybrid lossless audio compression
long_description    WavPack is a completely open audio compression format \
                    providing lossless, high-quality lossy, and a unique \
                    hybrid compression mode. Although the technology is \
                    loosely based on previous versions of WavPack, the new \
                    version 4 format has been designed from the ground up \
                    to offer unparalleled performance and functionality.
