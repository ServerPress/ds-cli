description         Lightweight in-process concurrent programming

long_description    The \"greenlet\" package is a spin-off of \
                    Stackless, a version of CPython that supports \
                    micro-threads called \"tasklets\". Tasklets run \
                    pseudo-concurrently (typically in a single or \
                    a few OS-level threads) and are synchronized \
                    with data exchanges on \"channels\". \
                    \
                    A \"greenlet\", on the other hand, is a still \
                    more primitive notion of micro-thread with no \
                    implicit scheduling\; coroutines, in other \
                    words. This is useful when you want to control \
                    exactly when your code runs. You can build \
                    custom scheduled micro-threads on top of \
                    greenlet\; however, it seems that greenlets are \
                    useful on their own as a way to make advanced \
                    control flow structures. For example, we can \
                    recreate generators\; the difference with \
                    Python's own generators is that our generators \
                    can call nested functions and the nested \
                    functions can yield values too. Additionally, \
                    you don't need a \"yield\" keyword. See the \
                    example in test_generator.py. \
                    \
                    Greenlets are provided as a C extension module \
                    for the regular unmodified interpreter.
