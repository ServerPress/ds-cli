+If you need to generate shell or other scripts with ePerl, i.e. you
+need a shebang line in the output of eperl, you have to add a shebang
+line containing e.g. "#!/usr/bin/eperl" first, because eperl will
+strip the first line from the input if it is a shebang line. Example:
+
+  #!/usr/bin/eperl
+  #!/bin/sh
+  echo <: print "quux"; :>
+
+will result in the following output:
+
+  #!/bin/sh
+  echo quux
+
 And finally you can use ePerl directly from within Perl programs by the use of
 the Parse::ePerl(3) package (assuming that you have installed this also; see
 file F<INSTALL> inside the ePerl distribution for more details):
