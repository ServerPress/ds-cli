                Less is a program similar to more, but which allows backward \
                movement in the file as well as forward movement. Also, less does \
                not have to read the entire input file before starting, so with \
                large input files it starts up faster than text editors like vi. \
                Less uses termcap (or terminfo on some systems), so it can run on \
                a variety of terminals. There is even limited support for \
                hardcopy terminals.
