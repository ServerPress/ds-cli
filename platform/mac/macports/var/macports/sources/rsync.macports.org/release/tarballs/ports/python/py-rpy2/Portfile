description         A simple and efficient access to R from Python

long_description    rpy2 is a redesign and rewrite of rpy. It is providing a \
                    low-level interface to R, a proposed high-level interface, \
                    including wrappers to graphical libraries, as well as R-like \
                    structures and functions.
