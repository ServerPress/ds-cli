description     high performance XML data processing with easy and powerful Tcl scripting functionality
long_description \
	tDOM combines high performance XML data processing with easy and \
	powerful Tcl scripting functionality. tDOM should be one of the fastest \
	ways to manipulate XML with a scripting language and uses very little \
	memory in the process (for example the DOM tree of the XML \
	recommendation in XML (160K) needs only about 450K in memory)! The tDOM \
	project was started by Jochen LÃ¶wer. It is currently maintained by Rolf Ade.
