  - Added proceed clause, the return value from the proceed block

    or from the catch
  - Changed except clause handling so that block is only evaluated
    once, the first time the result is required.

    second argument is a reference to a scalar, which if set to true
    will cause Error to continue looking for a catch/proceed block
    when the block returns.

    with an object.
