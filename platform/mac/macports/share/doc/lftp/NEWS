* new settings ftp:retry-530 and ftp:retry-530-anonymous. Retry on server
  reply 530 for PASS command if text matches these regular expressions.
  These settings should be useful to distinguish between overloaded server
  (temporary condition) and incorrect password (permanent condition).
* retry ftp login quickly on next address if the server has many (works
  well on ftp.redhat.com, for example).

Version 2.2.0 - 2000-03-28

* URLs are now handled in more places: `get URL1 -o URL2', `login URL',
  `glob URL', `cat URL', `mget URL/*', etc. Setting xfer:use-urls is obsolete,
  option -u is also obsolete but accepted for compatibility. Completion
  also works on URLs. `login URL' can be used to cache password for further
  URL usage.
* new settings xfer:eta-period and xfer:rate-period for calculation of eta
  and current rate.
* ascii mode transfers - `get -a', `put -a' etc.
* new settings net:connection-limit and net:connection-takeover to limit
  number of connections to the same site and allow take-over of background
  connections being used to do foreground operations.
* new setting ftp:use-abor. (default: yes) If set to no, lftp does not send
  ABOR command but closes data connection immediately.
* new settings net:reconnect-interval-multiplier and net:reconnect-interval-max,
  reconnect-interval renamed to reconnect-interval-base. It is possible to
  use short names, e.g. recon-int-b, recon-int-mul, recon-int-max.
* new setting ftp:list-options to append to every LIST command. E.g. it can
  be useful for some sites to set it to `-a'. Default is empty.
* new setting ftp:rest-stor (default: yes) to avoid file corruption
  on some old and buggy ftp servers after restarted upload.
* new setting net:no-proxy. It contains comma separated list of domains.
  Environment variable no_proxy is copied to net:no-proxy on startup.
* `glob' command can now select files by type. By default wildcards are
  expanded to list of plain files, option `-d' makes it expand to directories
  and `-a' - to files and directories.
* Commands `get', `put', `mget' and `mput' now have an option `-O base'
  which specifies base directory or URL to which the files should be placed.
* ftp to ftp (FXP) copying is now easy, e.g. `get ftp://... -o ftp://...' or
  `put ftp://...'. The command `ftpcopy' is now obsolete.
  New settings: ftp:use-fxp, ftp:fxp-passive-source. It does not work
  for some servers, so use `set ftp:use-fxp no' for them. FXP is also tried
  both ways - with passive and active source, if both fail it falls back to
  simple copy.
* now lftp remembers that commands MDTM, SIZE or SITE CHMOD are not supported
  by the server, and does not send them again.
* if password is entered on command line it is supposed to be insecure and is
  printed on screen and entered into bookmarks automatically.
* slightly better VMS support.
* EPLF listing format is now understood. It is used by anonftpd
  (e.g. ftp://vgsn.glasnet.ru).
* in globbing, if list restart is not used, don't skip list beginning but
  rather use it instead of previously received.
* ftp and hftp URLs are now assumed to have home-relative path. To write
  root-relative path in such URLs, use ftp://site/%2Fpath.
* new setting dns:use-fork. When true, lftp does fork before gethostbyname
  (as in previous versions) to allow instant interrupting and asynchronousity.
  (default is true)
* new setting cmd:default-protocol. The value is used when open is used
  with just host name without protocol. Default is `ftp'.
* new setting ftp:port-range for active mode port range (useful for firewalls).
* mirror --use-cache to allow mirror to use directory listing cache.
* check file names in ftp listings for slashes, don't use file names with
  slashes.
* ftp REST bug workaround - send REST 0 if last REST was >0.
* ftp server's 19100 in MDTM bug workaround.
* fixed completion and file name globbing for wu-ftpd-2.6.0. A long standing
  bug with multiple path component globbing over ftp has also been fixed.
