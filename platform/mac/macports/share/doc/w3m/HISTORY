2001/2/6
From: aito
* `Local cookie' mechanism is introduced to authorize local CGI.
  The behavior of CGI script using the local cookie is as follows:
  - w3m generates process-dependent `Local cookie'
  - on the local CGI invocation, w3m passes the script the local 
    cookie through the environment variable LOCAL_COOKIE.
  - the sctipt embeds the local cookie into the form for the next
    local CGI invocation.
  - on the next CGI invocation, the CGI script compares two local CGIs
    which are passed through CGI parameter and environment variable.
    If they are different, the script prohibits dangerous operations,
    such as file creation and file deletion.

* The local cookie mechanism is implemented on w3mbookmark and 
  w3mhelperpanel.

* On Linux, gcmain.c doesn't compile when the GC library is already
  installed in /usr/local/lib.

* There are websites using (unprintable) special characters (eg '0x96')

  (the only one i know), w3m doesn't check if characters are printable,
  thus they confuse particularly the /xfree/ xterm (knowing more special
  characters than other xterms). 
  Something like the attached patch could prevent this
  (also only affects western version).
  Instead of (superfluously) using isprint() with the locale,
  it now just checks the range (pointed out by Christian Weisgerber).

From: naddy@mips.rhein-neckar.de (Christian Weisgerber)
1. conn.eventMask is set to 0 which disables reception of all types
   of events. Effectively, this disables GPM support altogether.
   Probably "~0" was intended, to enable reception of all types of
   events.
2. conn.maxMod is set to ~0, which means that events with a modifier
   key (shift, control, etc.) set are also sent to w3m. Since w3m
   doesn't do anything with these events, they should rather be
   passed on to other clients. Changing this to "conn.maxMod = 0"
   will for example allow the use of the mouse in w3m *and* mouse
   clicks with shift held down for console cut-and-paste.

From: naddy@mips.rhein-neckar.de (Christian Weisgerber)
I would like to suggest a small change to w3m's GPM support:
Rather than explicitly drawing the mouse pointer, this could be left to
the server, i.e.
- remove GPM_DRAWPOINTER() calls,
- set conn.defaultMask to GPM_MOVE|GPM_HARD.

I was looking through the w3m source, and noticed that it defines the
following macro:
#define IS_SPACE(x) (isspace(x) && !(x&0x80))
Now this won't work as expected if x is an expression with side effects
(it will be evaluated twice). A quick grep of the sources reveals
several places where the macro is used like this:
file.c: if (IS_SPACE(*++p))
which is almost certainly a bug... (although I haven't tried to actually
work out what the effects of it would be).
