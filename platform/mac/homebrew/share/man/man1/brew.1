.SH "NAME"
\fBbrew\fR \- The missing package manager for OS X
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBbrew\fR \fB\-\-version\fR
.
.br
\fBbrew\fR \fIcommand\fR [\fB\-\-verbose\fR|\fB\-v\fR] [\fIoptions\fR] [\fIformula\fR] \.\.\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Homebrew is the easiest and most flexible way to install the UNIX tools Apple didn\'t include with OS X\.
.
.SH "ESSENTIAL COMMANDS"
For the full command list, see the \fICOMMANDS\fR section\.
.
.P
With \fB\-\-verbose\fR or \fB\-v\fR, many commands print extra debugging information\. Note that these flags should only appear after a command\.
.
.TP
\fBinstall\fR \fIformula\fR
Install \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBremove\fR \fIformula\fR
Uninstall \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBupdate\fR
Fetch the newest version of Homebrew from GitHub using \fBgit\fR(1)\.
.
.TP
\fBlist\fR
List all installed formulae\.
.
.TP
\fBsearch\fR \fItext\fR|\fB/\fR\fItext\fR\fB/\fR
Perform a substring search of formula names for \fItext\fR\. If \fItext\fR is surrounded with slashes, then it is interpreted as a regular expression\. The search for \fItext\fR is extended online to some popular taps\. If no search term is given, all locally available formulae are listed\.
.
.SH "COMMANDS"
.
.TP
\fBaudit\fR [\fB\-\-strict\fR] [\fB\-\-online\fR] [\fIformulae\fR]
Check \fIformulae\fR for Homebrew coding style violations\. This should be run before submitting a new formula\.
.
.IP
If no \fIformulae\fR are provided, all of them are checked\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-strict\fR is passed, additional checks are run\. This should be used when creating for new formulae\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-online\fR is passed, additional slower checks that require a network connection are run\. This should be used when creating for new formulae\.
.
.IP
\fBaudit\fR exits with a non\-zero status if any errors are found\. This is useful, for instance, for implementing pre\-commit hooks\.
.
.TP
\fBcat\fR \fIformula\fR
Display the source to \fIformula\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBcleanup\fR [\fB\-\-prune=\fR\fIdays\fR] [\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR] [\fB\-s\fR] [\fIformulae\fR]
For all installed or specific formulae, remove any older versions from the cellar\. In addition, old downloads from the Homebrew download\-cache are deleted\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-prune=\fR\fIdays\fR is specified, remove all cache files older than \fIdays\fR\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR or \fB\-n\fR is passed, show what would be removed, but do not actually remove anything\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-s\fR is passed, scrubs the cache, removing downloads for even the latest versions of formulae\. Note downloads for any installed formulae will still not be deleted\. If you want to delete those too: \fBrm \-rf $(brew \-\-cache)\fR
.
.TP
\fBcommand\fR \fIcmd\fR
Display the path to the file which is used when invoking \fBbrew\fR \fIcmd\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBcommands\fR [\fB\-\-quiet\fR [\fB\-\-include\-aliases\fR]]
Show a list of built\-in and external commands\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-quiet\fR is passed, list only the names of commands without the header\. With \fB\-\-include\-aliases\fR, the aliases of internal commands will be included\.
.
.TP
\fBconfig\fR
Show Homebrew and system configuration useful for debugging\. If you file a bug report, you will likely be asked for this information if you do not provide it\.
.
.TP
\fBcreate\fR \fIURL\fR [\fB\-\-autotools\fR|\fB\-\-cmake\fR] [\fB\-\-no\-fetch\fR] [\fB\-\-set\-name\fR \fIname\fR] [\fB\-\-set\-version\fR \fIversion\fR]
Generate a formula for the downloadable file at \fIURL\fR and open it in the editor\. Homebrew will attempt to automatically derive the formula name and version, but if it fails, you\'ll have to make your own template\. The \fBwget\fR formula serves as a simple example\. For the complete API have a look at
.
.IP
\fIhttp://www\.rubydoc\.info/github/Homebrew/homebrew/master/Formula\fR
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-autotools\fR is passed, create a basic template for an Autotools\-style build\. If \fB\-\-cmake\fR is passed, create a basic template for a CMake\-style build\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-no\-fetch\fR is passed, Homebrew will not download \fIURL\fR to the cache and will thus not add the SHA256 to the formula for you\.
.
.IP
The options \fB\-\-set\-name\fR and \fB\-\-set\-version\fR each take an argument and allow you to explicitly set the name and version of the package you are creating\.
.
.TP
\fBdeps\fR [\fB\-\-1\fR] [\fB\-n\fR] [\fB\-\-union\fR] [\fB\-\-tree\fR] [\fB\-\-all\fR] [\fB\-\-installed\fR] [\fB\-\-skip\-build\fR] [\fB\-\-skip\-optional\fR] \fIformulae\fR
Show dependencies for \fIformulae\fR\. When given multiple formula arguments, show the intersection of dependencies for \fIformulae\fR, except when passed \fB\-\-tree\fR, \fB\-\-all\fR, or \fB\-\-installed\fR\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-1\fR is passed, only show dependencies one level down, instead of recursing\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-n\fR is passed, show dependencies in topological order\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-union\fR is passed, show the union of dependencies for \fIformulae\fR, instead of the intersection\.
.
.IP

.
.IP
If \fB\-\-all\fR is passed, show dependencies for all formulae\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-installed\fR is passed, show dependencies for all installed formulae\.
.
.IP
By default, \fBdeps\fR shows dependencies for \fIformulae\fR\. To skip the \fB:build\fR type dependencies, pass \fB\-\-skip\-build\fR\. Similarly, pass \fB\-\-skip\-optional\fR to skip \fB:optional\fR dependencies\.
.
.TP
\fBdesc\fR \fIformula\fR
Display \fIformula\fR\'s name and one\-line description\.
.
.TP
\fBdesc\fR [\fB\-s\fR|\fB\-n\fR|\fB\-d\fR] \fIpattern\fR
Search both name and description (\fB\-s\fR), just the names (\fB\-n\fR), or just the descriptions (\fB\-d\fR) for \fB<pattern>\fR\. \fB<pattern>\fR is by default interpreted as a literal string; if flanked by slashes, it is instead interpreted as a regular expression\. Formula descriptions are cached; the cache is created on the first search, making that search slower than subsequent ones\.
.
.TP
\fBdiy\fR [\fB\-\-name=\fR\fIname\fR] [\fB\-\-version=\fR\fIversion\fR]
Automatically determine the installation prefix for non\-Homebrew software\.
.
.IP
Using the output from this command, you can install your own software into the Cellar and then link it into Homebrew\'s prefix with \fBbrew link\fR\.
.
.IP
The options \fB\-\-name=\fR\fIname\fR and \fB\-\-version=\fR\fIversion\fR each take an argument and allow you to explicitly set the name and version of the package you are installing\.

\fBln\fR, \fBlink\fR [\fB\-\-overwrite\fR] [\fB\-\-dry\-run\fR] [\fB\-\-force\fR] \fIformula\fR
Symlink all of \fIformula\fR\'s installed files into the Homebrew prefix\. This is done automatically when you install formulae but can be useful for DIY installations\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-overwrite\fR is passed, Homebrew will delete files which already exist in the prefix while linking\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-dry\-run\fR or \fB\-n\fR is passed, Homebrew will list all files which would be linked or which would be deleted by \fBbrew link \-\-overwrite\fR, but will not actually link or delete any files\.

Tap a formula repository\.
.
.IP
With \fIURL\fR unspecified, taps a formula repository from GitHub using HTTPS\. Since so many taps are hosted on GitHub, this command is a shortcut for \fBtap <user>/<repo> https://github\.com/<user>/homebrew\-<repo>\fR\.
.
.IP
With \fIURL\fR specified, taps a formula repository from anywhere, using any transport protocol that \fBgit\fR handles\. The one\-argument form of \fBtap\fR simplifies but also limits\. This two\-argument command makes no assumptions, so taps can be cloned from places other than GitHub and using protocols other than HTTPS, e\.g\., SSH, GIT, HTTP, FTP(S), RSYNC\.
.
.IP
By default, the repository is cloned as a shallow copy (\fB\-\-depth=1\fR), but if \fB\-\-full\fR is passed, a full clone will be used\.

.
.TP
\fBtest\fR [\fB\-\-devel\fR|\fB\-\-HEAD\fR] [\fB\-\-debug\fR] \fIformula\fR
A few formulae provide a test method\. \fBbrew test\fR \fIformula\fR runs this test method\. There is no standard output or return code, but it should generally indicate to the user if something is wrong with the installed formula\.
.
.IP
To test the development or head version of a formula, use \fB\-\-devel\fR or \fB\-\-HEAD\fR\.
.
.IP
If \fB\-\-debug\fR is passed and the test fails, an interactive debugger will be launched with access to IRB or a shell inside the temporary test directory\.

.
.TP
\fBunlinkapps\fR [\fB\-\-local\fR] [\fIformulae\fR]
Removes links created by \fBbrew linkapps\fR\.
.
.IP
If no \fIformulae\fR are provided, all linked app will be removed\.

\fB\-\-prefix\fR \fIformula\fR
Display the location in the cellar where \fIformula\fR is or would be installed\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-repository\fR
Display where Homebrew\'s \fB\.git\fR directory is located\. For standard installs, the \fBprefix\fR and \fBrepository\fR are the same directory\.
.
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
Print the version number of brew to standard error and exit\.
.
.SH "EXTERNAL COMMANDS"
Homebrew, like \fBgit\fR(1), supports external commands\. These are executable scripts that reside somewhere in the \fBPATH\fR, named \fBbrew\-\fR\fIcmdname\fR or \fBbrew\-\fR\fIcmdname\fR\fB\.rb\fR, which can be invoked like \fBbrew\fR \fIcmdname\fR\. This allows you to create your own commands without modifying Homebrew\'s internals\.
.
.P
Instructions for creating your own commands can be found in the docs: \fIhttps://github\.com/Homebrew/homebrew/blob/master/share/doc/homebrew/External\-Commands\.md\fR
.
.SH "SPECIFYING FORMULAE"
Many Homebrew commands accept one or more \fIformula\fR arguments\. These arguments can take several different forms:
.
.TP
The name of a formula
e\.g\. \fBgit\fR, \fBnode\fR, \fBwget\fR\.
.
.TP
The fully\-qualified name of a tapped formula
Sometimes a formula from a tapped repository may conflict with one in \fBHomebrew/homebrew\fR\. You can still access these formulae by using a special syntax, e\.g\. \fBhomebrew/dupes/vim\fR or \fBhomebrew/versions/node4\fR\.
.
.TP
An arbitrary URL
Homebrew can install formulae via URL, e\.g\. \fBhttps://raw\.github\.com/Homebrew/homebrew/master/Library/Formula/git\.rb\fR\. The formula file will be cached for later use\.
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.
.TP
\fBAWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID\fR, \fBAWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY\fR
When using the \fBS3\fR download strategy, Homebrew will look in these variables for access credentials (see \fIhttps://docs\.aws\.amazon\.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli\-chap\-getting\-started\.html#cli\-environment\fR to retrieve these access credentials from AWS)\. If they are not set, the \fBS3\fR download strategy will download with a public (unsigned) URL\.
.
.TP
\fBBROWSER\fR
If set, and \fBHOMEBREW_BROWSER\fR is not, use \fBBROWSER\fR as the web browser when opening project homepages\.
.
.TP
\fBEDITOR\fR
If set, and \fBHOMEBREW_EDITOR\fR and \fBVISUAL\fR are not, use \fBEDITOR\fR as the text editor\.
.
.TP
\fBGIT\fR
When using Git, Homebrew will use \fBGIT\fR if set, a Homebrew\-built Git if installed, or the system\-provided binary\.
.
.IP
Set this to force Homebrew to use a particular git binary\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_BOTTLE_DOMAIN\fR
If set, instructs Homebrew to use the given URL as a download mirror for bottles\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_BROWSER\fR
If set, uses this setting as the browser when opening project homepages, instead of the OS default browser\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_BUILD_FROM_SOURCE\fR
If set, instructs Homebrew to compile from source even when a formula provides a bottle\. This environment variable is intended for use by Homebrew developers\. Please do not file issues if you encounter errors when using this environment variable\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_CACHE\fR
If set, instructs Homebrew to use the given directory as the download cache\.
.
.IP
\fIDefault:\fR \fB~/Library/Caches/Homebrew\fR if it exists; otherwise, \fB/Library/Caches/Homebrew\fR\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_CURL_VERBOSE\fR
If set, Homebrew will pass \fB\-\-verbose\fR when invoking \fBcurl\fR(1)\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG\fR
If set, any commands that can emit debugging information will do so\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG_INSTALL\fR
When \fBbrew install \-d\fR or \fBbrew install \-i\fR drops into a shell, \fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG_INSTALL\fR will be set to the name of the formula being brewed\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG_PREFIX\fR
When \fBbrew install \-d\fR or \fBbrew install \-i\fR drops into a shell, \fBHOMEBREW_DEBUG_PREFIX\fR will be set to the target prefix in the Cellar of the formula being brewed\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_DEVELOPER\fR
If set, Homebrew will print warnings that are only relevant to Homebrew developers (active or budding)\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_EDITOR\fR
If set, Homebrew will use this editor when editing a single formula, or several formulae in the same directory\.
.
.IP
\fINOTE\fR: \fBbrew edit\fR will open all of Homebrew as discontinuous files and directories\. TextMate can handle this correctly in project mode, but many editors will do strange things in this case\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_GITHUB_API_TOKEN\fR
A personal access token for the GitHub API, which you can create at \fIhttps://github\.com/settings/tokens\fR\. If set, GitHub will allow you a greater number of API requests\. See \fIhttps://developer\.github\.com/v3/#rate\-limiting\fR for more information\. Homebrew uses the GitHub API for features such as \fBbrew search\fR\.
.
.IP
\fINOTE\fR: Homebrew doesn\'t require permissions for any of the scopes\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_LOGS\fR
If set, Homebrew will use the given directory to store log files\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_MAKE_JOBS\fR
If set, instructs Homebrew to use the value of \fBHOMEBREW_MAKE_JOBS\fR as the number of parallel jobs to run when building with \fBmake\fR(1)\.
.
.IP
\fIDefault:\fR the number of available CPU cores\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_NO_EMOJI\fR
If set, Homebrew will not print the \fBHOMEBREW_INSTALL_BADGE\fR on a successful build\.
.
.IP
\fINote:\fR Homebrew will only try to print emoji on Lion or newer\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_NO_INSECURE_REDIRECT\fR
If set, Homebrew will not permit redirects from secure HTTPS to insecure HTTP\.
.
.IP
While ensuring your downloads are fully secure, this is likely to cause from\-source Sourceforge & GNOME based formulae to fail to download\.
.
.IP
Apache formulae are currently unaffected by this variable and can redirect to plaintext\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_NO_GITHUB_API\fR
If set, Homebrew will not use the GitHub API for e\.g searches or fetching relevant issues on a failed install\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_INSTALL_BADGE\fR
Text printed before the installation summary of each successful build\. Defaults to the beer emoji\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_SVN\fR
When exporting from Subversion, Homebrew will use \fBHOMEBREW_SVN\fR if set, a Homebrew\-built Subversion if installed, or the system\-provided binary\.
.
.IP
Set this to force Homebrew to use a particular \fBsvn\fR binary\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_TEMP\fR
If set, instructs Homebrew to use \fBHOMEBREW_TEMP\fR as the temporary directory for building packages\. This may be needed if your system temp directory and Homebrew Prefix are on different volumes, as OS X has trouble moving symlinks across volumes when the target does not yet exist\.
.
.IP
This issue typically occurs when using FileVault or custom SSD configurations\.
.
.TP
\fBHOMEBREW_VERBOSE\fR
If set, Homebrew always assumes \fB\-\-verbose\fR when running commands\.
.
.TP
\fBVISUAL\fR
If set, and \fBHOMEBREW_EDITOR\fR is not, use \fBVISUAL\fR as the text editor\.
.
.SH "USING HOMEBREW BEHIND A PROXY"
Homebrew uses several commands for downloading files (e\.g\. \fBcurl\fR, \fBgit\fR, \fBsvn\fR)\. Many of these tools can download via a proxy\. It\'s common for these tools to read proxy parameters from environment variables\.
.
.P
For the majority of cases setting \fBhttp_proxy\fR is enough\. You can set this in your shell profile, or you can use it before a brew command:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

http_proxy=http://<host>:<port> brew install foo
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
If your proxy requires authentication:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

http_proxy=http://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port> brew install foo
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
