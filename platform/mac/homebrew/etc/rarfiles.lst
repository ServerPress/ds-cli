; File order list for solid archiving
;
; Here you may modify the file list which tells RAR the order in which
; to add files to a solid archive.
;
; This file may contain file names, wildcards and a special entry - $default.
; The default entry defines the position in the order list for files not
; matched with other entries in this file. Lines beginning with the semicolon
; symbol ';' are considered as comments and not processed.
;
; Place this file in the same directory as RAR.EXE.
;
; Tips to provide improved compression and speed of operation:
;
; - files containing similar information should be grouped together in the
;   archive if possible;
; - frequently accessed files should be placed at the beginning.
