Historical notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Initially, ELinks was a development version of Links (Lynx-like text WWW
browser), with more liberal features policy and development style.  Its purpose
was to provide an alternative to Links, and to test and tune various new
features, but still provide good rock-solid releases inside stable branches.

Why not contribute to Links instead?  Well, first I made a bunch of patches for
the original Links, but Mikulas wasn't around to integrate them, so I started
releasing my fork. When he came back, a significant number of them got refused
because Mikulas did not like them, as he just wouldn't have any use for them
himself.  He wants to keep Links with a relatively closed feature set and merge
only new features which he himself needs.  It has advantages that the tree is
very narrow and the code is small and contains very little bloat.

ELinks, on the contrary, aims to provide a full-featured web browser, superior
to both lynx and w3m and with the power (but not slowness and memory usage) of
Mozilla, Konqueror and similar browsers. However, to prevent drastic bloating
of the code, the development is driven in the course of modularization and
separation of add-on modules (like cookies, bookmarks, ssl, scripting etc).
