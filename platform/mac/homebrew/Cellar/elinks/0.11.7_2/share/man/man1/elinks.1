.SH "NAME"
elinks \- lynx-like alternative character mode WWW browser
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fIelinks\fR [OPTION]\&... [URL]\&...
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fIELinks\fR is a text mode WWW browser, supporting colors, table rendering, background downloading, menu driven configuration interface, tabbed browsing and slim code\&.
.sp
Frames are supported\&. You can have different file formats associated with external viewers\&. mailto: and telnet: are supported via external clients\&.
.sp
ELinks can handle both local files and remote URLs\&. The main supported remote URL protocols are \fIHTTP\fR, \fIHTTPS\fR (with SSL support compiled in) and \fIFTP\fR\&. Additional protocol support exists for \fIBitTorrent\fR \fIfinger\fR, \fIGopher\fR, \fISMB\fR and \fINNTP\fR\&.
.sp
The homepage of \fIELinks\fR can be found at <http://elinks\&.cz/>, where the ELinks manual is also hosted\&.
.sp
.SH "OPTIONS"
Most options can be set in the user interface or config file, so usually you do not need to care about them\&. Note that this list is roughly equivalent to the output of running ELinks with the option \-\-long\-help\&.
.PP
\-anonymous [0|1] (default: 0)
.RS 4
Restricts
\fIELinks\fR
so it can run on an anonymous account\&. Local file browsing, downloads, and modification of options will be disabled\&. Execution of viewers is allowed, but entries in the association table can\'t be added or modified\&.
.RE
.PP
\-auto\-submit [0|1] (default: 0)
.RS 4
Automatically submit the first form in the given URLs\&.
.RE
.PP
\-base\-session <num> (default: 0)
.RS 4
Used internally when opening
\fIELinks\fR
instances in new windows\&. The ID maps to information that will be used when creating the new instance\&. You don\'t want to use it\&.
.RE
.PP
\-config\-dir <str> (default: "")
.RS 4
Path of the directory
\fIELinks\fR
will read and write its config and runtime state files to instead of
~/\&.elinks\&. If the path does not begin with a \'/\' it is assumed to be relative to your
\fIHOME\fR
directory\&.
.RE
.PP

Print a configuration file with options set to the built\-in defaults to stdout\&.
.RE
.PP
\-config\-file <str> (default: "elinks\&.conf")

The default MIME type used for documents of unknown type\&.
.RE
.PP
\-default\-keys [0|1] (default: 0)
.RS 4
When set, all keybindings from configuration files will be ignored\&. It forces use of default keybindings and will reset user\-defined ones on save\&.

.PP
\-dump [0|1] (default: 0)
.RS 4
Print formatted plain\-text versions of given URLs to stdout\&.
.RE
.PP

.fi
.RE
.RE
.PP
\-force\-html
.RS 4
Makes
\fIELinks\fR
assume documents of unknown types are HTML\&. Useful when using
\fIELinks\fR
as an external viewer from MUAs\&. This is equivalent to
\-default\-mime\-type
text/html\&.
.RE
.PP
\-?, \-h, \-help
.RS 4
Print usage help and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-localhost [0|1] (default: 0)
.RS 4
Restricts
\fIELinks\fR

.RE
.PP
\-long\-help
.RS 4
Print detailed usage help and exit\&.
.RE
.PP
\-lookup

.RE
.PP
\-no\-connect [0|1] (default: 0)
.RS 4
Run
\fIELinks\fR
as a separate instance instead of connecting to an existing instance\&. Note that normally no runtime state files (bookmarks, history, etc\&.) are written to the disk when this option is used\&. See also
\-touch\-files\&.
.RE
.PP
\-no\-home [0|1] (default: 0)
.RS 4
Disables creation and use of files in the user specific home configuration directory (~/\&.elinks)\&. It forces default configuration values to be used and disables saving of runtime state files\&.
.RE
.PP
\-no\-numbering (alias for document\&.dump\&.numbering)

\-dump, nothing else\&.

.RS 4
Prevents printing of references (URIs) of document links in dump output\&. Note that this really affects only
\-dump, nothing else\&.
.RE
.PP
\-remote
.RS 4
Control a remote
\fIELinks\fR
instance by passing commands to it\&. The option takes an additional argument containing the method which should be invoked and any parameters that should be passed to it\&. For ease of use, the additional method argument can be omitted in which case any URL arguments will be opened in new tabs in the remote instance\&. Following is a list of the supported methods:
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'
ping(): look for a remote instance
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'
openURL(): prompt URL in current tab
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'
openURL(URL): open URL in current tab
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'
openURL(URL, new\-tab): open URL in new tab
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'

.RE
.RE
.PP
\-session\-ring <num> (default: 0)
.RS 4
ID of session ring this
\fIELinks\fR
session should connect to\&.
\fIELinks\fR
works in so\-called session rings, whereby all instances of
\fIELinks\fR
are interconnected and share state (cache, bookmarks, cookies, and so on)\&. By default, all
\fIELinks\fR
instances connect to session ring 0\&. You can change that behaviour with this switch and form as many session rings as you want\&. Obviously, if the session\-ring with this number doesn\'t exist yet, it\'s created and this \'ELinks\' instance will become the master instance (that usually doesn\'t matter for you as a user much)\&. Note that you usually don\'t want to use this unless you\'re a developer and you want to do some testing \- if you want the
\fIELinks\fR
instances each running standalone, rather use the
\-no\-connect
command\-line option\&. Also note that normally no runtime state files are written to the disk when this option is used\&. See also
\-touch\-files\&.
.RE
.PP
\-source [0|1] (default: 0)
.RS 4
Print given URLs in source form to stdout\&.
.RE
.PP
\-touch\-files [0|1] (default: 0)
.RS 4
When enabled, runtime state files (bookmarks, history, etc\&.) are written to disk, even when
\-no\-connect
or
\-session\-ring
is used\&. The option has no effect if not used in conjunction with any of these options\&.
.RE
.PP
\-verbose <num> (default: 1)
.RS 4
The verbose level controls what messages are shown at start up and while running:
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'0: means only show serious errors
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'1: means show serious errors and warnings
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'2: means show all messages
