The ChangeLog file has been removed. You can get the equivalent information
by doing

	$ cg log

in a checked out GIT tree, or using the gitweb interface available at:

	http://repo.or.cz/w/elinks.git

The data in the main repository reaches back to 2005-09-16, when
ELinks switched from CVS to GIT.  To see changes made in CVS before
that, download the history with the contrib/grafthistory.sh script.
Unfortunately, because files in the CVS repository have been moved or
copied around, checking out a historical version often places files in
the wrong directories.  The history is usable for git-blame, however.
It is currently also viewable at these sites:

	http://pasky.or.cz/gitweb.cgi?p=elinks-history.git
	http://cvsweb.elinks.cz/cvsweb.cgi/elinks/
