.SH "NAME"
git-show \- Show various types of objects
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit show\fR [options] <object>\&...
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits)\&.
.sp
For commits it shows the log message and textual diff\&. It also presents the merge commit in a special format as produced by \fIgit diff\-tree \-\-cc\fR\&.
.sp
For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects\&.
.sp
For trees, it shows the names (equivalent to \fIgit ls\-tree\fR with \-\-name\-only)\&.
.sp
For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents\&.
.sp
The command takes options applicable to the \fIgit diff\-tree\fR command to control how the changes the commit introduces are shown\&.
.sp
This manual page describes only the most frequently used options\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
<object>\&...
.RS 4
The names of objects to show\&. For a more complete list of ways to spell object names, see "SPECIFYING REVISIONS" section in
\fBgitrevisions\fR(7)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-pretty[=<format>], \-\-format=<format>
.RS 4
Pretty\-print the contents of the commit logs in a given format, where
\fI<format>\fR
can be one of
\fIoneline\fR,
\fIshort\fR,
\fImedium\fR,
\fIfull\fR,
\fIfuller\fR,
\fIemail\fR,
\fIraw\fR,
\fIformat:<string>\fR
and
\fItformat:<string>\fR\&. When
\fI<format>\fR
is none of the above, and has
\fI%placeholder\fR
in it, it acts as if
\fI\-\-pretty=tformat:<format>\fR
were given\&.
.sp
See the "PRETTY FORMATS" section for some additional details for each format\&. When
\fI=<format>\fR
part is omitted, it defaults to
\fImedium\fR\&.
.sp
Note: you can specify the default pretty format in the repository configuration (see
\fBgit-config\fR(1))\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev\-commit
.RS 4
Instead of showing the full 40\-byte hexadecimal commit object name, show only a partial prefix\&. Non default number of digits can be specified with "\-\-abbrev=<n>" (which also modifies diff output, if it is displayed)\&.
.sp
This should make "\-\-pretty=oneline" a whole lot more readable for people using 80\-column terminals\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-abbrev\-commit
.RS 4
Show the full 40\-byte hexadecimal commit object name\&. This negates
\-\-abbrev\-commit
and those options which imply it such as "\-\-oneline"\&. It also overrides the
\fIlog\&.abbrevCommit\fR
variable\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-oneline
.RS 4
This is a shorthand for "\-\-pretty=oneline \-\-abbrev\-commit" used together\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-encoding=<encoding>
.RS 4
The commit objects record the encoding used for the log message in their encoding header; this option can be used to tell the command to re\-code the commit log message in the encoding preferred by the user\&. For non plumbing commands this defaults to UTF\-8\&. Note that if an object claims to be encoded in
X
and we are outputting in
X, we will output the object verbatim; this means that invalid sequences in the original commit may be copied to the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-notes[=<ref>]
.RS 4
Show the notes (see
\fBgit-notes\fR(1)) that annotate the commit, when showing the commit log message\&. This is the default for
git log,
git show
and
git whatchanged
commands when there is no
\-\-pretty,
\-\-format, or
\-\-oneline
option given on the command line\&.
.sp
By default, the notes shown are from the notes refs listed in the
\fIcore\&.notesRef\fR
and
\fInotes\&.displayRef\fR
variables (or corresponding environment overrides)\&. See
\fBgit-config\fR(1)
for more details\&.
.sp
With an optional
\fI<ref>\fR
argument, show this notes ref instead of the default notes ref(s)\&. The ref specifies the full refname when it begins with
refs/notes/; when it begins with
notes/,
refs/
and otherwise
refs/notes/
is prefixed to form a full name of the ref\&.
.sp
Multiple \-\-notes options can be combined to control which notes are being displayed\&. Examples: "\-\-notes=foo" will show only notes from "refs/notes/foo"; "\-\-notes=foo \-\-notes" will show both notes from "refs/notes/foo" and from the default notes ref(s)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-notes
.RS 4
Do not show notes\&. This negates the above
\-\-notes
option, by resetting the list of notes refs from which notes are shown\&. Options are parsed in the order given on the command line, so e\&.g\&. "\-\-notes \-\-notes=foo \-\-no\-notes \-\-notes=bar" will only show notes from "refs/notes/bar"\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-show\-notes[=<ref>], \-\-[no\-]standard\-notes
.RS 4
These options are deprecated\&. Use the above \-\-notes/\-\-no\-notes options instead\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-show\-signature
.RS 4
Check the validity of a signed commit object by passing the signature to
gpg \-\-verify
and show the output\&.
.RE
.SH "PRETTY FORMATS"
.sp
If the commit is a merge, and if the pretty\-format is not \fIoneline\fR, \fIemail\fR or \fIraw\fR, an additional line is inserted before the \fIAuthor:\fR line\&. This line begins with "Merge: " and the sha1s of ancestral commits are printed, separated by spaces\&. Note that the listed commits may not necessarily be the list of the \fBdirect\fR parent commits if you have limited your view of history: for example, if you are only interested in changes related to a certain directory or file\&.
.sp
There are several built\-in formats, and you can define additional formats by setting a pretty\&.<name> config option to either another format name, or a \fIformat:\fR string, as described below (see \fBgit-config\fR(1))\&. Here are the details of the built\-in formats:
.sp

.sp
.if n \{\

.nf

This is designed to be as compact as possible\&.

\fIraw\fR
.sp
The
\fIraw\fR
format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the commit object\&. Notably, the SHA\-1s are displayed in full, regardless of whether \-\-abbrev or \-\-no\-abbrev are used, and
\fIparents\fR
information show the true parent commits, without taking grafts or history simplification into account\&. Note that this format affects the way commits are displayed, but not the way the diff is shown e\&.g\&. with
git log \-\-raw\&. To get full object names in a raw diff format, use
\-\-no\-abbrev\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
\fIformat:<string>\fR
.sp
The
\fIformat:<string>\fR
format allows you to specify which information you want to show\&. It works a little bit like printf format, with the notable exception that you get a newline with
\fI%n\fR
instead of
\fI\en\fR\&.
.sp
E\&.g,
\fIformat:"The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was >>%s<<%n"\fR
would show something like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
The author of fe6e0ee was Junio C Hamano, 23 hours ago
The title was >>t4119: test autocomputing \-p<n> for traditional diff input\&.<<

The

In other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries\&.

.sp
It affects the way a change that amounts to a total rewrite of a file not as a series of deletion and insertion mixed together with a very few lines that happen to match textually as the context, but as a single deletion of everything old followed by a single insertion of everything new, and the number
m
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 60%)\&.
\-B/70%

.sp
When used with \-M, a totally\-rewritten file is also considered as the source of a rename (usually \-M only considers a file that disappeared as the source of a rename), and the number
n
controls this aspect of the \-B option (defaults to 50%)\&.

If generating diffs, detect and report renames for each commit\&. For following files across renames while traversing history, see

n

\-M90%

\-M5

Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation\&. <when> can be either "none", "untracked", "dirty" or "all", which is the default\&. Using "none" will consider the submodule modified when it either contains untracked or modified files or its HEAD differs from the commit recorded in the superproject and can be used to override any settings of the

or
\fBgitmodules\fR(5)\&. When "untracked" is used submodules are not considered dirty when they only contain untracked content (but they are still scanned for modified content)\&. Using "dirty" ignores all changes to the work tree of submodules, only changes to the commits stored in the superproject are shown (this was the behavior until 1\&.7\&.0)\&.

.SH "GENERATING PATCHES WITH -P"
.sp
When "git\-diff\-index", "git\-diff\-tree", or "git\-diff\-files" are run with a \fI\-p\fR option, "git diff" without the \fI\-\-raw\fR option, or "git log" with the "\-p" option, they do not produce the output described above; instead they produce a patch file\&. You can customize the creation of such patches via the GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF and the GIT_DIFF_OPTS environment variables\&.
.sp
What the \-p option produces is slightly different from the traditional diff format:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2

.sp
.if n \{\

.nf
diff \-\-git a/file1 b/file2
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE

.sp
The
a/
and
b/
filenames are the same unless rename/copy is involved\&. Especially, even for a creation or a deletion,
/dev/null
is
\fInot\fR
used in place of the
a/
or
b/
filenames\&.
.sp
When rename/copy is involved,
file1

file2
show the name of the source file of the rename/copy and the name of the file that rename/copy produces, respectively\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c

deleted file mode <mode>
new file mode <mode>

similarity index <number>
dissimilarity index <number>
index <hash>\&.\&.<hash> <mode>
.fi
.if n \{\

.sp
File modes are printed as 6\-digit octal numbers including the file type and file permission bits\&.
.sp
Path names in extended headers do not include the
a/
and
b/
prefixes\&.
.sp
The similarity index is the percentage of unchanged lines, and the dissimilarity index is the percentage of changed lines\&. It is a rounded down integer, followed by a percent sign\&. The similarity index value of 100% is thus reserved for two equal files, while 100% dissimilarity means that no line from the old file made it into the new one\&.
.sp
The index line includes the SHA\-1 checksum before and after the change\&. The <mode> is included if the file mode does not change; otherwise, separate lines indicate the old and the new mode\&.
.RE

TAB, LF, double quote and backslash characters in pathnames are represented as

All the

Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from accidentally feeding it to

Unlike the traditional \fIunified\fR diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single column that has \- (minus \(em appears in A but removed in B), + (plus \(em missing in A but added to B), or " " (space \(em unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files file1, file2,\&... with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN\&. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to note how X\(cqs line is different from it\&.
.sp
A \- character in the column N means that the line appears in fileN but it does not appear in the result\&. A + character in the column N means that the line appears in the result, and fileN does not have that line (in other words, the line was added, from the point of view of that parent)\&.
.sp
In the above example output, the function signature was changed from both files (hence two \- removals from both file1 and file2, plus ++ to mean one line that was added does not appear in either file1 or file2)\&. Also eight other lines are the same from file1 but do not appear in file2 (hence prefixed with +)\&.
.sp
When shown by git diff\-tree \-c, it compares the parents of a merge commit with the merge result (i\&.e\&. file1\&.\&.fileN are the parents)\&. When shown by git diff\-files \-c, it compares the two unresolved merge parents with the working tree file (i\&.e\&. file1 is stage 2 aka "our version", file2 is stage 3 aka "their version")\&.

Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as sequences of non\-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding conversions (except on Mac and Windows)\&. Therefore, using non\-ASCII path names will mostly work even on platforms and file systems that use legacy extended ASCII encodings\&. However, repositories created on such systems will not work properly on UTF\-8\-based systems (e\&.g\&. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa\&. Additionally, many Git\-based tools simply assume path names to be UTF\-8 and will fail to display other encodings correctly\&.

Although we encourage that the commit log messages are encoded in UTF\-8, both the core and Git Porcelain are designed not to force UTF\-8 on projects\&.

\fIgit commit\fR

issues a warning if the commit log message given to it does not look like a valid UTF\-8 string, unless you explicitly say your project uses a legacy encoding\&. The way to say this is to have i18n\&.commitencoding in

Commit objects created with the above setting record the value of
