.SH "NAME"
git-clean \- Remove untracked files from the working tree
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit clean\fR [\-d] [\-f] [\-i] [\-n] [\-q] [\-e <pattern>] [\-x | \-X] [\-\-] <path>\&...
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not under version control, starting from the current directory\&.
.sp
Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the \fI\-x\fR option is specified, ignored files are also removed\&. This can, for example, be useful to remove all build products\&.
.sp
If any optional <path>\&.\&.\&. arguments are given, only those paths are affected\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-d
.RS 4
Remove untracked directories in addition to untracked files\&. If an untracked directory is managed by a different Git repository, it is not removed by default\&. Use \-f option twice if you really want to remove such a directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-f, \-\-force
.RS 4
If the Git configuration variable clean\&.requireForce is not set to false,
\fIgit clean\fR
will refuse to delete files or directories unless given \-f, \-n or \-i\&. Git will refuse to delete directories with \&.git sub directory or file unless a second \-f is given\&. This affects also git submodules where the storage area of the removed submodule under \&.git/modules/ is not removed until \-f is given twice\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i, \-\-interactive
.RS 4
Show what would be done and clean files interactively\&. See \(lqInteractive mode\(rq for details\&.
.RE
.PP
\-n, \-\-dry\-run
.RS 4
Don\(cqt actually remove anything, just show what would be done\&.
.RE
.PP
\-q, \-\-quiet
.RS 4
Be quiet, only report errors, but not the files that are successfully removed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-e <pattern>, \-\-exclude=<pattern>
.RS 4
In addition to those found in \&.gitignore (per directory) and $GIT_DIR/info/exclude, also consider these patterns to be in the set of the ignore rules in effect\&.
.RE
.PP
\-x
.RS 4
Don\(cqt use the standard ignore rules read from \&.gitignore (per directory) and $GIT_DIR/info/exclude, but do still use the ignore rules given with
\-e
options\&. This allows removing all untracked files, including build products\&. This can be used (possibly in conjunction with
\fIgit reset\fR) to create a pristine working directory to test a clean build\&.
.RE
.PP
\-X
.RS 4
Remove only files ignored by Git\&. This may be useful to rebuild everything from scratch, but keep manually created files\&.
.RE
.SH "INTERACTIVE MODE"
.sp
When the command enters the interactive mode, it shows the files and directories to be cleaned, and goes into its interactive command loop\&.
.sp
The command loop shows the list of subcommands available, and gives a prompt "What now> "\&. In general, when the prompt ends with a single \fI>\fR, you can pick only one of the choices given and type return, like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
    *** Commands ***
        1: clean                2: filter by pattern    3: select by numbers
        4: ask each             5: quit                 6: help
    What now> 1
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
You also could say c or clean above as long as the choice is unique\&.
.sp
The main command loop has 6 subcommands\&.
.PP
clean
.RS 4
Start cleaning files and directories, and then quit\&.
.RE
.PP
filter by pattern
.RS 4
This shows the files and directories to be deleted and issues an "Input ignore patterns>>" prompt\&. You can input space\-separated patterns to exclude files and directories from deletion\&. E\&.g\&. "*\&.c *\&.h" will excludes files end with "\&.c" and "\&.h" from deletion\&. When you are satisfied with the filtered result, press ENTER (empty) back to the main menu\&.
.RE
.PP
select by numbers
.RS 4
This shows the files and directories to be deleted and issues an "Select items to delete>>" prompt\&. When the prompt ends with double
\fI>>\fR
like this, you can make more than one selection, concatenated with whitespace or comma\&. Also you can say ranges\&. E\&.g\&. "2\-5 7,9" to choose 2,3,4,5,7,9 from the list\&. If the second number in a range is omitted, all remaining items are selected\&. E\&.g\&. "7\-" to choose 7,8,9 from the list\&. You can say
\fI*\fR
to choose everything\&. Also when you are satisfied with the filtered result, press ENTER (empty) back to the main menu\&.
.RE
.PP
ask each
.RS 4
This will start to clean, and you must confirm one by one in order to delete items\&. Please note that this action is not as efficient as the above two actions\&.
.RE
.PP
quit
.RS 4
This lets you quit without do cleaning\&.
.RE
.PP
help
.RS 4
Show brief usage of interactive git\-clean\&.
