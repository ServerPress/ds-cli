.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
List commits that are reachable by following the parent links from the given commit(s), but exclude commits that are reachable from the one(s) given with a \fI^\fR in front of them\&. The output is given in reverse chronological order by default\&.
.sp
You can think of this as a set operation\&. Commits given on the command line form a set of commits that are reachable from any of them, and then commits reachable from any of the ones given with \fI^\fR in front are subtracted from that set\&. The remaining commits are what comes out in the command\(cqs output\&. Various other options and paths parameters can be used to further limit the result\&.
.sp
Thus, the following command:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        $ git rev\-list foo bar ^baz
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
means "list all the commits which are reachable from \fIfoo\fR or \fIbar\fR, but not from \fIbaz\fR"\&.
.sp
A special notation "\fI<commit1>\fR\&.\&.\fI<commit2>\fR" can be used as a short\-hand for "^\*(Aq<commit1>\*(Aq \fI<commit2>\fR"\&. For example, either of the following may be used interchangeably:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        $ git rev\-list origin\&.\&.HEAD
        $ git rev\-list HEAD ^origin
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Another special notation is "\fI<commit1>\fR\&...\fI<commit2>\fR" which is useful for merges\&. The resulting set of commits is the symmetric difference between the two operands\&. The following two commands are equivalent:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
        $ git rev\-list A B \-\-not $(git merge\-base \-\-all A B)
        $ git rev\-list A\&.\&.\&.B
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
\fIrev\-list\fR is a very essential Git command, since it provides the ability to build and traverse commit ancestry graphs\&. For this reason, it has a lot of different options that enables it to be used by commands as different as \fIgit bisect\fR and \fIgit repack\fR\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.SS "Commit Limiting"
.sp
Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the special notations explained in the description, additional commit limiting may be applied\&.
.sp
Using more options generally further limits the output (e\&.g\&. \-\-since=<date1> limits to commits newer than <date1>, and using it with \-\-grep=<pattern> further limits to commits whose log message has a line that matches <pattern>), unless otherwise noted\&.
.sp
Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting options, such as \-\-reverse\&.
.PP
\-<number>, \-n <number>, \-\-max\-count=<number>
.RS 4
Limit the number of commits to output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-skip=<number>
.RS 4
Skip
\fInumber\fR
commits before starting to show the commit output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-since=<date>, \-\-after=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits more recent than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-until=<date>, \-\-before=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits older than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-max\-age=<timestamp>, \-\-min\-age=<timestamp>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to specified time range\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-author=<pattern>, \-\-committer=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that match the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\-\-author=<pattern>, commits whose author matches any of the given patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple
\-\-committer=<pattern>)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-grep\-reflog=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that match the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\-\-grep\-reflog, commits whose reflog message matches any of the given patterns are chosen\&. It is an error to use this option unless
\-\-walk\-reflogs
is in use\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-grep=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with log message that matches the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\-\-grep=<pattern>, commits whose message matches any of the given patterns are chosen (but see
\-\-all\-match)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-all\-match
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones that match all given
\-\-grep, instead of ones that match at least one\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-invert\-grep
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with log message that do not match the pattern specified with
\-\-grep=<pattern>\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i, \-\-regexp\-ignore\-case
.RS 4
Match the regular expression limiting patterns without regard to letter case\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-basic\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular expressions; this is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\-E, \-\-extended\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions instead of the default basic regular expressions\&.
.RE
.PP
\-F, \-\-fixed\-strings
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don\(cqt interpret pattern as a regular expression)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-perl\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl\-compatible regular expressions\&. Requires libpcre to be compiled in\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-remove\-empty
.RS 4
Stop when a given path disappears from the tree\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-merges
.RS 4
Print only merge commits\&. This is exactly the same as
\-\-min\-parents=2\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-merges
.RS 4
Do not print commits with more than one parent\&. This is exactly the same as
\-\-max\-parents=1\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-min\-parents=<number>, \-\-max\-parents=<number>, \-\-no\-min\-parents, \-\-no\-max\-parents
.RS 4
Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many parent commits\&. In particular,
\-\-max\-parents=1
is the same as
\-\-no\-merges,
\-\-min\-parents=2
is the same as
\-\-merges\&.
\-\-max\-parents=0
gives all root commits and
\-\-min\-parents=3
all octopus merges\&.
.sp
\-\-no\-min\-parents
and
\-\-no\-max\-parents
reset these limits (to no limit) again\&. Equivalent forms are
\-\-min\-parents=0
(any commit has 0 or more parents) and
\-\-max\-parents=\-1
(negative numbers denote no upper limit)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-first\-parent
.RS 4
Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit\&. This option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual commits brought in to your history by such a merge\&. Cannot be combined with \-\-bisect\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-not
.RS 4
Reverses the meaning of the
\fI^\fR
prefix (or lack thereof) for all following revision specifiers, up to the next
\-\-not\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-all
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in
refs/
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-branches[=<pattern>]
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in
refs/heads
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. If
\fI<pattern>\fR
is given, limit branches to ones matching given shell glob\&. If pattern lacks
\fI?\fR,
\fI*\fR, or
\fI[\fR,
\fI/*\fR
at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-tags[=<pattern>]
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in
refs/tags
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. If
\fI<pattern>\fR
is given, limit tags to ones matching given shell glob\&. If pattern lacks
\fI?\fR,
\fI*\fR, or
\fI[\fR,
\fI/*\fR
at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-remotes[=<pattern>]
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in
refs/remotes
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. If
\fI<pattern>\fR
is given, limit remote\-tracking branches to ones matching given shell glob\&. If pattern lacks
\fI?\fR,
\fI*\fR, or
\fI[\fR,
\fI/*\fR
at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-glob=<glob\-pattern>
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob
\fI<glob\-pattern>\fR
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. Leading
\fIrefs/\fR, is automatically prepended if missing\&. If pattern lacks
\fI?\fR,
\fI*\fR, or
\fI[\fR,
\fI/*\fR
at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exclude=<glob\-pattern>
.RS 4
Do not include refs matching
\fI<glob\-pattern>\fR
that the next
\-\-all,
\-\-branches,
\-\-tags,
\-\-remotes, or
\-\-glob
would otherwise consider\&. Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion patterns up to the next
\-\-all,
\-\-branches,
\-\-tags,
\-\-remotes, or
\-\-glob
option (other options or arguments do not clear accumulated patterns)\&.
.sp
The patterns given should not begin with
refs/heads,
refs/tags, or
refs/remotes
when applied to
\-\-branches,
\-\-tags, or
\-\-remotes, respectively, and they must begin with
refs/
when applied to
\-\-glob
or
\-\-all\&. If a trailing
\fI/*\fR
is intended, it must be given explicitly\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-reflog
.RS 4
Pretend as if all objects mentioned by reflogs are listed on the command line as
<commit>\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ignore\-missing
.RS 4
Upon seeing an invalid object name in the input, pretend as if the bad input was not given\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-stdin
.RS 4
In addition to the
\fI<commit>\fR
listed on the command line, read them from the standard input\&. If a
\fI\-\-\fR
separator is seen, stop reading commits and start reading paths to limit the result\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-quiet
.RS 4
Don\(cqt print anything to standard output\&. This form is primarily meant to allow the caller to test the exit status to see if a range of objects is fully connected (or not)\&. It is faster than redirecting stdout to
/dev/null
as the output does not have to be formatted\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry\-mark
.RS 4
Like
\-\-cherry\-pick
(see below) but mark equivalent commits with
=
rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with
+\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry\-pick
.RS 4
Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another commit on the \(lqother side\(rq when the set of commits are limited with symmetric difference\&.
.sp
For example, if you have two branches,
A
and
B, a usual way to list all commits on only one side of them is with
\-\-left\-right
(see the example below in the description of the
\-\-left\-right
option)\&. However, it shows the commits that were cherry\-picked from the other branch (for example, \(lq3rd on b\(rq may be cherry\-picked from branch A)\&. With this option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-left\-only, \-\-right\-only
.RS 4
List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric range, i\&.e\&. only those which would be marked
<
resp\&.
>
by
\-\-left\-right\&.
.sp
For example,
\-\-cherry\-pick \-\-right\-only A\&.\&.\&.B
omits those commits from
B
which are in
A
or are patch\-equivalent to a commit in
A\&. In other words, this lists the
+
commits from
git cherry A B\&. More precisely,
\-\-cherry\-pick \-\-right\-only \-\-no\-merges
gives the exact list\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry
.RS 4
A synonym for
\-\-right\-only \-\-cherry\-mark \-\-no\-merges; useful to limit the output to the commits on our side and mark those that have been applied to the other side of a forked history with
git log \-\-cherry upstream\&.\&.\&.mybranch, similar to
git cherry upstream mybranch\&.
.RE
.PP
\-g, \-\-walk\-reflogs
.RS 4
Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from the most recent one to older ones\&. When this option is used you cannot specify commits to exclude (that is,
\fI^commit\fR,
\fIcommit1\&.\&.commit2\fR, and
\fIcommit1\&.\&.\&.commit2\fR
notations cannot be used)\&.
.sp
With
\-\-pretty
format other than
oneline
(for obvious reasons), this causes the output to have two extra lines of information taken from the reflog\&. By default,
\fIcommit@{Nth}\fR
notation is used in the output\&. When the starting commit is specified as
\fIcommit@{now}\fR, output also uses
\fIcommit@{timestamp}\fR
notation instead\&. Under
\-\-pretty=oneline, the commit message is prefixed with this information on the same line\&. This option cannot be combined with
\-\-reverse\&. See also
\fBgit-reflog\fR(1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-merge
.RS 4
After a failed merge, show refs that touch files having a conflict and don\(cqt exist on all heads to merge\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-boundary
.RS 4
Output excluded boundary commits\&. Boundary commits are prefixed with
\-\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-use\-bitmap\-index
.RS 4
Try to speed up the traversal using the pack bitmap index (if one is available)\&. Note that when traversing with
\-\-objects, trees and blobs will not have their associated path printed\&.
.RE
.SS "History Simplification"
.sp
Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for example the commits modifying a particular <path>\&. But there are two parts of \fIHistory Simplification\fR, one part is selecting the commits and the other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify the history\&.
.sp
The following options select the commits to be shown:
.PP
<paths>
.RS 4
Commits modifying the given <paths> are selected\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-simplify\-by\-decoration
.RS 4
Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are selected\&.
.RE
.sp
Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful history\&.
.sp
The following options affect the way the simplification is performed:
.PP
Default mode
.RS 4
Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining the final state of the tree\&. Simplest because it prunes some side branches if the end result is the same (i\&.e\&. merging branches with the same content)
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-history
.RS 4
Same as the default mode, but does not prune some history\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-dense
.RS 4
Only the selected commits are shown, plus some to have a meaningful history\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-sparse
.RS 4
All commits in the simplified history are shown\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-simplify\-merges
.RS 4
Additional option to
\-\-full\-history
to remove some needless merges from the resulting history, as there are no selected commits contributing to this merge\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-ancestry\-path
.RS 4
When given a range of commits to display (e\&.g\&.
\fIcommit1\&.\&.commit2\fR
or
\fIcommit2 ^commit1\fR), only display commits that exist directly on the ancestry chain between the
\fIcommit1\fR
and
\fIcommit2\fR, i\&.e\&. commits that are both descendants of
\fIcommit1\fR, and ancestors of
\fIcommit2\fR\&.
.RE
.sp
A more detailed explanation follows\&.
.sp
Suppose you specified foo as the <paths>\&. We shall call commits that modify foo !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME\&. (In a diff filtered for foo, they look different and equal, respectively\&.)
.sp
In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to illustrate the differences between simplification settings\&. We assume that you are filtering for a file foo in this commit graph:

I

.RE
.sp
rev\-list walks backwards through history, including or excluding commits based on whether \-\-full\-history and/or parent rewriting (via \-\-parents or \-\-children) are used\&. The following settings are available\&.
.PP
Default mode
.RS 4
Commits are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent (though this can be changed, see
\-\-sparse
below)\&. If the commit was a merge, and it was TREESAME to one parent, follow only that parent\&. (Even if there are several TREESAME parents, follow only one of them\&.) Otherwise, follow all parents\&.
.sp
This results in:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
          \&.\-A\-\-\-N\-\-\-O
         /     /   /
        I\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-\-D
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
Note how the rule to only follow the TREESAME parent, if one is available, removed
B
from consideration entirely\&.
C
was considered via
N, but is TREESAME\&. Root commits are compared to an empty tree, so
I
is !TREESAME\&.
.sp
Parent/child relations are only visible with
\-\-parents, but that does not affect the commits selected in default mode, so we have shown the parent lines\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-history without parent rewriting
.RS 4
This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them\&. Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4

\fIraw\fR

The
\fIraw\fR
format shows the entire commit exactly as stored in the commit object\&. Notably, the SHA\-1s are displayed in full, regardless of whether \-\-abbrev or \-\-no\-abbrev are used, and
\fIparents\fR
information show the true parent commits, without taking grafts or history simplification into account\&. Note that this format affects the way commits are displayed, but not the way the diff is shown e\&.g\&. with
git log \-\-raw\&. To get full object names in a raw diff format, use
\-\-no\-abbrev\&.

\fIformat:<string>\fR

The
\fIformat:<string>\fR
format allows you to specify which information you want to show\&. It works a little bit like printf format, with the notable exception that you get a newline with
\fI%n\fR
instead of
\fI\en\fR\&.
.sp

\fIformat:"The author of %h was %an, %ar%nThe title was >>%s<<%n"\fR

Some placeholders may depend on other options given to the revision traversal engine\&. For example, the %g* reflog options will insert an empty string unless we are traversing reflog entries (e\&.g\&., by git log \-g)\&.

\fItformat:\fR
.sp
The
\fItformat:\fR
format works exactly like
\fIformat:\fR, except that it provides "terminator" semantics instead of "separator" semantics\&. In other words, each commit has the message terminator character (usually a newline) appended, rather than a separator placed between entries\&. This means that the final entry of a single\-line format will be properly terminated with a new line, just as the "oneline" format does\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\

.fi
.if n \{\

In addition, any unrecognized string that has a

tformat:
