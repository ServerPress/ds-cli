.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
This merges the file listing in the directory cache index with the actual working directory list, and shows different combinations of the two\&.
.sp
One or more of the options below may be used to determine the files shown:
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-c, \-\-cached
.RS 4
Show cached files in the output (default)
.RE
.PP
\-d, \-\-deleted
.RS 4
Show deleted files in the output
.RE
.PP
\-m, \-\-modified
.RS 4
Show modified files in the output
.RE
.PP
\-o, \-\-others
.RS 4
Show other (i\&.e\&. untracked) files in the output
.RE
.PP
\-i, \-\-ignored
.RS 4
Show only ignored files in the output\&. When showing files in the index, print only those matched by an exclude pattern\&. When showing "other" files, show only those matched by an exclude pattern\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s, \-\-stage
.RS 4
Show staged contents\*(Aq object name, mode bits and stage number in the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-directory
.RS 4
If a whole directory is classified as "other", show just its name (with a trailing slash) and not its whole contents\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-empty\-directory
.RS 4
Do not list empty directories\&. Has no effect without \-\-directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-u, \-\-unmerged
.RS 4
Show unmerged files in the output (forces \-\-stage)
.RE
.PP
\-k, \-\-killed
.RS 4
Show files on the filesystem that need to be removed due to file/directory conflicts for checkout\-index to succeed\&.
.RE
.PP
\-z
.RS 4
\e0 line termination on output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-x <pattern>, \-\-exclude=<pattern>
.RS 4
Skip untracked files matching pattern\&. Note that pattern is a shell wildcard pattern\&. See EXCLUDE PATTERNS below for more information\&.
.RE
.PP
\-X <file>, \-\-exclude\-from=<file>
.RS 4
Read exclude patterns from <file>; 1 per line\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exclude\-per\-directory=<file>
.RS 4
Read additional exclude patterns that apply only to the directory and its subdirectories in <file>\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exclude\-standard
.RS 4
Add the standard Git exclusions: \&.git/info/exclude, \&.gitignore in each directory, and the user\(cqs global exclusion file\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-error\-unmatch
.RS 4
If any <file> does not appear in the index, treat this as an error (return 1)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-with\-tree=<tree\-ish>
.RS 4
When using \-\-error\-unmatch to expand the user supplied <file> (i\&.e\&. path pattern) arguments to paths, pretend that paths which were removed in the index since the named <tree\-ish> are still present\&. Using this option with
\-s
or
\-u
options does not make any sense\&.
.RE
.PP
\-t
.RS 4
This feature is semi\-deprecated\&. For scripting purpose,
\fBgit-status\fR(1)\-\-porcelain
and
\fBgit-diff-files\fR(1)\-\-name\-status
are almost always superior alternatives, and users should look at
\fBgit-status\fR(1)\-\-short
or
\fBgit-diff\fR(1)\-\-name\-status
for more user\-friendly alternatives\&.
.sp
This option identifies the file status with the following tags (followed by a space) at the start of each line:
.RE
.PP
H
.RS 4
cached
.RE
.PP
S
.RS 4
skip\-worktree
.RE
.PP
M
.RS 4
unmerged
.RE
.PP
R
.RS 4
removed/deleted
.RE
.PP
C
.RS 4
modified/changed
.RE
.PP
K
.RS 4
to be killed
.RE
.PP
?
.RS 4
other
.RE
.PP
\-v
.RS 4
Similar to
\-t, but use lowercase letters for files that are marked as
\fIassume unchanged\fR
(see
\fBgit-update-index\fR(1))\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-name
.RS 4
When run from a subdirectory, the command usually outputs paths relative to the current directory\&. This option forces paths to be output relative to the project top directory\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-abbrev[=<n>]
.RS 4
Instead of showing the full 40\-byte hexadecimal object lines, show only a partial prefix\&. Non default number of digits can be specified with \-\-abbrev=<n>\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-debug
.RS 4
After each line that describes a file, add more data about its cache entry\&. This is intended to show as much information as possible for manual inspection; the exact format may change at any time\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-
.RS 4
Do not interpret any more arguments as options\&.
.RE
.PP
<file>
.RS 4
Files to show\&. If no files are given all files which match the other specified criteria are shown\&.
.RE
.SH "OUTPUT"
.sp
\fIgit ls\-files\fR just outputs the filenames unless \fI\-\-stage\fR is specified in which case it outputs:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[<tag> ]<mode> <object> <stage> <file>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
\fIgit ls\-files \-\-unmerged\fR and \fIgit ls\-files \-\-stage\fR can be used to examine detailed information on unmerged paths\&.
.sp
For an unmerged path, instead of recording a single mode/SHA\-1 pair, the index records up to three such pairs; one from tree O in stage 1, A in stage 2, and B in stage 3\&. This information can be used by the user (or the porcelain) to see what should eventually be recorded at the path\&. (see \fBgit-read-tree\fR(1) for more information on state)
.sp
When \-z option is not used, TAB, LF, and backslash characters in pathnames are represented as \et, \en, and \e\e, respectively\&.
.SH "EXCLUDE PATTERNS"
.sp
\fIgit ls\-files\fR can use a list of "exclude patterns" when traversing the directory tree and finding files to show when the flags \-\-others or \-\-ignored are specified\&. \fBgitignore\fR(5) specifies the format of exclude patterns\&.
.sp
These exclude patterns come from these places, in order:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
The command\-line flag \-\-exclude=<pattern> specifies a single pattern\&. Patterns are ordered in the same order they appear in the command line\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
The command\-line flag \-\-exclude\-from=<file> specifies a file containing a list of patterns\&. Patterns are ordered in the same order they appear in the file\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  3." 4.2
.\}
The command\-line flag \-\-exclude\-per\-directory=<name> specifies a name of the file in each directory
\fIgit ls\-files\fR
examines, normally
\&.gitignore\&. Files in deeper directories take precedence\&. Patterns are ordered in the same order they appear in the files\&.
.RE
.sp
A pattern specified on the command line with \-\-exclude or read from the file specified with \-\-exclude\-from is relative to the top of the directory tree\&. A pattern read from a file specified by \-\-exclude\-per\-directory is relative to the directory that the pattern file appears in\&.
