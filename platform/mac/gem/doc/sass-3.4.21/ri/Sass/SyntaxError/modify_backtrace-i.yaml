- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Modify the top Sass backtrace entries (that is, the most deeply nested ones) to have the given attributes.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Specifically, this goes through the backtrace entries from most deeply nested to least, setting the given attributes for each entry. If an entry already has one of the given attributes set, the pre-existing attribute takes precedence and is not used for less deeply-nested entries (even if they don't have that attribute set).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "@param attrs [{Symbol =&gt; Object}] The information to add to the backtrace entry."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  See \\{#sass_backtrace}\n"
