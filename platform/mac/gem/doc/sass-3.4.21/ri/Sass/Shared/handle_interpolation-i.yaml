comment: 
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Scans through a string looking for the interoplation-opening `#{` and, when it's found, yields the scanner to the calling code so it can handle it properly.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The scanner will have any backslashes immediately in front of the `#{` as the second capture group (`scan[2]`), and the text prior to that as the first (`scan[1]`).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "@yieldparam scan [StringScanner] The scanner scanning through the string @return [String] The text remaining in the scanner after all `#{`s have been processed"
