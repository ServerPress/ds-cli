  body: "{CommaSequence} is the toplevel selector, representing a comma-separated sequence of {Sequence}s, such as `foo bar, baz bang`. {Sequence} is the next level, representing {SimpleSequence}s separated by combinators (e.g. descendant or child), such as `foo bar` or `foo &gt; bar baz`. {SimpleSequence} is a sequence of selectors that all apply to a single element, such as `foo.bar[attr=val]`. Finally, {Simple} is the superclass of the simplest selectors, such as `.foo` or `#bar`."

    body: The base used for calculating selector specificity. The spec says this should be &quot;sufficiently high&quot;; it's extremely unlikely that any single selector sequence will contain 1,000 simple selectors.
