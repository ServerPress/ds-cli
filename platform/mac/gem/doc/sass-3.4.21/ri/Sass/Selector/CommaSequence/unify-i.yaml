- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Unifies this with another comma selector to produce a selector that matches (a subset of) the intersection of the two inputs.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "@param other [CommaSequence] @return [CommaSequence, nil] The unified selector, or nil if unification failed. @raise [Sass::SyntaxError] If this selector cannot be unified."
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  This will only ever occur when a dynamic selector,\n  such as {Parent} or {Interpolation}, is used in unification.\n  Since these selectors should be resolved\n  by the time extension and unification happen,\n  this exception will only ever be raised as a result of programmer error\n"
