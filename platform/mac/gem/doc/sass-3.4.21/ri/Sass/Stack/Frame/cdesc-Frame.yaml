  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: The type of this stack frame. This can be `:import`, `:mixin`, or `:base`.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
    body: `:base` indicates that this is the bottom-most frame, meaning that it represents a single line of code rather than a nested context. The stack will only ever have one base frame, and it will always be the most deeply-nested frame.
