- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: The global load paths for Sass files. This is meant for plugins and libraries to register the paths to their Sass stylesheets to that they may be `@imported`. This load path is used by every instance of {Sass::Engine}. They are lower-precedence than any load paths passed in via the {file:SASS_REFERENCE.md#load_paths-option `:load_paths` option}.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: If the `SASS_PATH` environment variable is set, the initial value of `load_paths` will be initialized based on that. The variable should be a colon-separated list of path names (semicolon-separated on Windows).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Note that files on the global load path are never compiled to CSS themselves, even if they aren't partials. They exist only to be imported.
