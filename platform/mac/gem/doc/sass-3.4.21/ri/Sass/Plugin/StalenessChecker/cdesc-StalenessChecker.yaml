  body: The class handles `.s[ca]ss` file staleness checks via their mtime timestamps.

  body: "To speed things up two level of caches are employed:"

  contents:

    label: "*"
    body: A class-level dependency cache which stores @import paths for each file. This is a long-lived cache that is reused by every StalenessChecker instance.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: Three short-lived instance-level caches, one for file mtimes, one for whether a file is stale during this particular run. and one for the parse tree for a file. These are only used by a single StalenessChecker instance.

  body: "Usage:"
- !ruby/object:SM::Flow::LIST 
  contents: 
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: For a one-off staleness check of a single `.s[ca]ss` file, the class-level {stylesheet_needs_update?} method should be used.
  - !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::LI 
    label: "*"
    body: "For a series of staleness checks (e.g. checking all files for staleness) a StalenessChecker instance should be created, and the instance-level \\{#stylesheet_needs_update?} method should be used. the caches should make the whole process significantly faster. <b>WARNING</b>: It is important not to retain the instance for too long, as its instance-level caches are never explicitly expired."
