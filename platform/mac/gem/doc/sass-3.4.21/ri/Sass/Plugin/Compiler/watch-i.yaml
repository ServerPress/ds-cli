- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Watches the template directory (or directories) and updates the CSS files whenever the related Sass/SCSS files change. `watch` never returns.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Whenever a change is detected to a Sass/SCSS file in {file:SASS_REFERENCE.md#template_location-option `:template_location`}, the corresponding CSS file in {file:SASS_REFERENCE.md#css_location-option `:css_location`} will be recompiled. The CSS files of any Sass/SCSS files that import the changed file will also be recompiled.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Before the watching starts in earnest, `watch` calls \{#update_stylesheets}.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Note that `watch` uses the [Listen](http://github.com/guard/listen) library to monitor the filesystem for changes. Listen isn't loaded until `watch` is run. The version of Listen distributed with Sass is loaded by default, but if another version has already been loaded that will be used instead.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "@param individual_files [Array&lt;(String, String[, String])&gt;]"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  A list of files to check for updates\n  **in addition to those specified by the\n  {file:SASS_REFERENCE.md#template_location-option `:template_location` option}.**\n  The first string in each pair is the location of the Sass/SCSS file,\n  the second is the location of the CSS file that it should be compiled to.\n  The third string, if provided, is the location of the Sourcemap file.\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "@param options [Hash] The options that control how watching works. @option options [Boolean] :skip_initial_update"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "  Don't do an initial update when starting the watcher when true\n"
