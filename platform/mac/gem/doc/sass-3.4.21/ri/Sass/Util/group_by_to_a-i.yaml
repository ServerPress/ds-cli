- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Performs the equivalent of `enum.group_by.to_a`, but with a guaranteed order. Unlike {Util#hash_to_a}, the resulting order isn't sorted key order; instead, it's the same order as `#group_by` has under Ruby 1.9 (key appearance order).
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "@param enum [Enumerable] @return [Array&lt;[Object, Array]&gt;] An array of pairs."
