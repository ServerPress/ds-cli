- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Like `Pathname#cleanpath`, but normalizes Windows paths to always use backslash separators. Normally, `Pathname#cleanpath` actually does the reverse -- it will convert backslashes to forward slashes, which can break `Pathname#relative_path_from`.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "@param path [String, Pathname] @return [Pathname]"
full_name: Sass::Util#cleanpath
