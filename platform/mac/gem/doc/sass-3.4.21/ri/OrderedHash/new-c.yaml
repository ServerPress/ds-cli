- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: In MRI the Hash class is core and written in C. In particular, methods are programmed with explicit C function calls and polymorphism is not honored.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: For example, []= is crucial in this implementation to maintain the @keys array but hash.c invokes rb_hash_aset() originally. This prevents method reuse through inheritance and forces us to reimplement stuff.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: "For instance, we cannot use the inherited #merge! because albeit the algorithm itself would work, our []= is not being called at all by the C code."
