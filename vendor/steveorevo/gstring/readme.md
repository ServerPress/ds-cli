# GString

Implements OOP String handling with useful parsing functions. Strings to be handled as objects and features my basic cross language parsing functions del/get left/right, available in javascript, perl, asp, php, realstudio, vb, lingo, etc. or contact me for a language near you ;-)

Added Michael Scribellito's Java-like string manipulation functions with no-conflict, existing class checking.

## Change Log
* Renamed from String to GString, because PHP7 chaps my hide! String is now a reserved word and cannot be used as a class, object, or extended in PHP7.
